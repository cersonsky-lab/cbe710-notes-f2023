```{glossary}
partial molar property,
    denoted by an
    overline; indicates the change in an extensive thermodynamic
    variable as the number of particles in a system changes. This
    notation will be used in our discussion of multiphase systems, as
    partial molar properties are useful for discussing changes to a
    system's property upon a change in the number of a single component



mechanical equilibrium
    if a system has movable boundaries, at
    equilibrium the pressure of the system will be equivalent to the
    pressure of the surroundings

chemical equilibrium
    if a system has open boundaries, at
    equilibrium the chemical potential of each component of the system
    will be equivalent to the chemical potential of each component in
    the surroundings
