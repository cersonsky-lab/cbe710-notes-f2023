## Fluctuations

In the [last lecture](Lecture8B), we introdued the Ising model as a simple model that
incorporates interactions between molecules. We showed that it is very
challenging to handle interactions analytically because we cannot
factorize the partition funtion, and instead used {term}`mean-field theory` to
approximate the interaction between each spin and its neighbors as
equivalent to the average interaction between spins in the entire
system. Mean-field theory is a convenient approximation that can
simplify systems sufficiently to allow for analytical approximations.

However, by assuming that the local properties of each region of a
system can be approximated by the average properties of the entire
system, mean-field theory neglects the local fluctuations throughout a
system (or fluctuations in system properties as a function of time) that
can be important. Hence, we will close our study of statistical
mechanics by discussing the importance of fluctuations and how these can
be connected to macroscopic quantities, thus providing information
neglected by mean-field theory.

We begin by clarifying what is meant by *fluctuations* in this context.
Consider the energy, $E_j$, of a system described by the canonical
ensemble (fixed $NVT$). The energy can vary between many different
equivalent microstates of the canonical ensemble with different values
of the energy $E_j$, and we can define an ensemble average value of
$\langle E \rangle = \sum_j p_j E_j$. We can think of fluctuations in
the energy in two different ways. First, we can imagine examining the
system as a function of time, and periodically recording the
instantaneous energy, $E(t)$. At each snapshot of the system,
$E(t) = E_j$, in other words, the system by definition will be in some
microstate such that its energy at time $t$ will have a value equal to
$E_j$.

Recall the the [ergodic hypothesis](Lecture2.md#postulate-1-the-time-average-value-of-a-thermodynamic-parameter-y-of-a-system-is-equal-to-the-ensemble-average-value-of-y),
that says that over sufficiently long times
$\int E(t) dt = \langle E \rangle$. That is, all microstates will be
visited according to their Boltzmann-weighted probabilities and we can
observe the ensemble average value of $E$. Fluctuations by this
definition then refer to the expected *temporal* variation in $E(t)$ as
the system evolves in time. However, because ergodicity establishes the
equivalence of temporal measurements and ensemble averages, we can also
think of fluctuations in the energy as a measure of the variance in the
energy in the ensemble of microstates - i.e. simply a statistical
quantity which reflects the distribution of energies accessible to a
system. The key point here is that temporal fluctuations in the quantity
are exactly equal to the statistical fluctuations in that quantity over
long enough observation times such that ergodicity establishes the
equivalence of the temporal average and ensemble average.

Having established the definition of fluctuations, why do we care?
Well, our fluctuations are related to our

$C_v = \left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V}$

Taking the *statistical* definition of fluctuations, we can write the
ensemble-average variance, $\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle$, in the
canonical ensemble as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &= \langle (E - \langle E \rangle )^2 \rangle \\
&=  \langle E^2 -  2 E \langle E \rangle +  \langle E \rangle^2 \rangle \\
&= \langle E^2 \rangle - 2 \langle E \rangle \langle E \rangle + \langle E \rangle ^2 \\
&= \langle E^2 \rangle  - \langle E \rangle ^2
\end{aligned}$$

Here we have simply rewritten the ensemble-averaged square fluctuation
(i.e., the ensemble-averaged variance) in terms of ensemble averages of
the energy itself. We can now use the equations from the {term}`canonical ensemble`.

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle  = \langle E^2 \rangle  - \langle E \rangle ^2 &= \sum_j p_j E_j ^2 - \left (\sum_j p_j E_j \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_j E_j^2 e^{-\beta E_j} - \left (  \frac{1}{Z} \sum_j E_j e^{-\beta E_j}\right )^2
\end{aligned}$$

We next recognize that from the definition of the {term}`canonical partition function`,
$Z = \sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}$, we get
$\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} = -\sum_j E_j e^{-\beta E_j}$.
Therefore the above expression becomes:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &= \frac{1}{Z} \left (  \frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial \beta^2} \right )_{N, V} - \left ( \frac{1}{Z} \left (  \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V} \right )^2 \\
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \left ( \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V} \\
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \left ( \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}
\end{aligned}$$

Note the use of the product rule to simplify the first line to the
second line. We recall from [Lecture 3](Lecture3) that
$\langle E \rangle = -\left ( \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}$
to get:

$$
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &= -\left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}  \\
&= k_B \left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V} \left ( \frac{\partial T}{\partial T^{-1}} \right )_{N, V}\\
&= k_B T^2 \left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V} \\
&= k_BT ^2 C_V
$$

In the last line, we recognize that
$\left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V}$
is the heat capacity at constant volume, an experimentally
measurable material constant.
```

This relationship is remarkable - it shows
that the fluctuation (either with respect to time or with respect to the
variation in the statistical ensemble) of energy in a system at fixed
$NVT$ is related to the rate at which energy in that system changes due
to changes in the temperature. We call $C_V$ a *thermodynamic response
function*; that is, it shows the response of a system (i.e. change in
energy) at equilibrium to a change in a parameter (i.e. the
temperature). The relation above shows that microscopic fluctuations in
the energy are a measure of the thermodynamic response of a system.

This relationship is strictly derived only at equilibrium, since
everything we have done so far in statistical mechanics is at
equilibrium; it turns out that similar relationships between statistical
fluctuations and the response of a system also occur in non-equilibrium
processes, leading to the so-called fluctuation-dissipation
relationship, but that is outside of the scope of this lecture.

The relationship between fluctuations and a thermodynamic response
illustrates a new means of calculating the heat capacity of the
material. Without knowledge of this relationship, the simplest way to
calculate the heat capacity would be to perform multiple experiments at
different temperatures, measure the corresponding system energy, and
equate $C_V$ to the slope of the resulting line. Instead, our equation
for heat capacity shows that we could take a single system at a
fixed temperature and instead measure the fluctuations of the energy
over time to obtain $C_V$ in a single experiment. Such measurements will
be possible using computer simulations as we will discuss in future
lectures. We could also derive the fluctuations of other quantities,
such as the density, and connect these to other materials parameters as
a general means of computing response functions from equilibrium
fluctuations.

## Size of fluctuations and the equivalence of ensembles

The next question we will address how large fluctuations actually are
relative to the average energy of the system. If fluctuations are much
smaller than the average energy of the system, then the system energy
will appear approximately constant. To determine the relative size of
fluctuations, we recognize that the heat capacity, $C_V$, is extensive
and scales with the number of particles of the system, and thus is of
order $N$ (this was explicitly shown for an ideal gas). The energy, $E$,
is also extensive and scales with $N$ (also shown for an ideal gas). The
ratio of fluctuations to the average energy is then:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt{\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle}}{\langle E \rangle} &=  \frac{\sqrt{k_BT ^2 C_V}}{\langle E \rangle} \\
&\approx \frac{\sqrt{N}}{N}\\
&\approx N^{-1/2}
\end{aligned}$$

This scaling analysis indicates that if $N$ is a large number (e.g. on
the order of $10^{23}$ particles), then the ratio of fluctuations to the
average energy approaches zero and the energy of the system is
effectively constant. Thus, in the large $N$ limit the average energy
calculated from the canonical ensemble will be identical to the average
energy of a microcanonical ensemble because energy fluctuations are
negligible - and this is exactly the limit in which classical
thermodynamics is valid.

To illustrate this point in just a bit more detail, we can write the
equation for the canonical partition function by summing over all energy
levels, and including the explicit degeneracy of energy level $\nu$:

$$Z(N,V,T) = \sum_\nu \Omega(N,V,E_\nu) e^{-\beta E_\nu}$$

In the large $N$ limit, we just showed that only a single value of
$E_\nu$, the ensemble average value, is meaningful, as fluctuations away
from this value are unlikely. Thus, the degeneracy
$\Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)$ is significantly larger than any other
term in the summation, and we can write the partition function instead
as:

$$Z(N,V,T) = \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle) e^{-\beta\langle E \rangle}$$

Taking the logarithm of this expression and equating to the Helmholtz
free energy yields:

$$\begin{aligned}
F &= -k_BT \ln Z(N,V,T) \\ 
&= -k_B T \ln \left [ \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle) e^{-\beta\langle E \rangle} \right ] \\
&= \langle E \rangle -k_B T \ln \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)
\end{aligned}$$

We can compare this last expression to the thermodynamic definition of
the Helmholtz free energy, $F = E - TS$. Therefore, we get that
$S = k_B \ln \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)$, the Boltzmann entropy used
to define the microcanonical ensemble, and we see that the two ensembles
make equivalent predictions for the Helmholtz free energy. Similar
measures of equivalency could be performed in the thermodynamic limit
for other ensembles as well.

There are thus four important conclusions to draw from our study of
fluctuations:

1. that in the thermodynamic limit, fluctuations are
negligible, and hence we can discuss single values of thermodynamic
variables as being equivalent to ensemble averages;
2. that in the thermodynamic limit all ensembles are equivalent, and hence we can use
any ensemble that is mathematically convenient to relate molecular
properties to macroscopic observables;
3. that microscopic fluctuations are proportional to a response function,
both in equilibrium and in non-equilibrium processes;
4. fluctuations are measurable properties of a system that can be used to inform experimental measurements (e.g.
in light scattering).

## Summary of other topics

We have now finished our overview of statistical mechanics and will
transition into an alternative approach to calculating the statistical
properties of many-body, interacting systems via computer simulations.
However, it is useful to emphasize that we have only scratched the
surface of modern statistical mechanics, and that there many other
topics of importance. Briefly, here are some topics of interest that we
have not discussed:

-   Kinetic theory of gases (although we will touch on this in the next
    unit)

-   Topics in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, such as linear
    response theory

-   Renormalization group approaches to phase transitions

-   Correlation functions and order parameters

-   Landau-Ginsburg models for phase transitions

-   Statistical mechanics of surfaces

If you're interested in these topics, I am happy to point you toward
relevant textbooks.
