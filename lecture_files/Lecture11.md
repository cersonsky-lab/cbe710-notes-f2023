## Importance sampling 
One major hitch up to this point has been our probability distribution --
in the area example, we directly sampled this by selecting points at random.
In our determinate equations, we had it predetermined. 

To evaluate ensemble averages from the canonical ensemble, we can choose
our probability density, $p(x)$,
to maximize the likelihood of sampling configurations that
contribute meaningfully to the calculation of the ensemble average. This
is the essence of

```{glossary}
importance sampling
    sampling from a distribution of states in order to maximize the
    information gained from each observation
```

First, let's recall that the probability of finding the system in a given microstate of the
canonical ensemble, $p(\textbf{r}^N)_{NVT}$, is related to the Boltzmann
factor for that state normalized by the partition function. We can then
write:

$$\begin{aligned}
p(\textbf{r}^N)_{NVT} &= \frac{\exp \left [-\beta E(\mathbf{r}^N)\right ]}{Z} \\
\langle Y \rangle_{NVT} &= \int d \mathbf{r}^N p(\textbf{r}^N)_{NVT}  Y(\mathbf{r}^N) 
\end{aligned}$$

The ensemble average then has the same form as $F = \int_a^b f(x) dx$ if
we let 
$f(x) = p(\mathbf{r}^N)_{NVT} Y(\mathbf{r}^N)$. Following the reasoning
above, we can then approximate $\langle Y \rangle_{NVT}$ by:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle Y \rangle_{NVT} = \left \langle \frac{ p(\mathbf{r}^N)_{NVT} Y(\mathbf{r}^N) }{p(\mathbf{r}^N)} \right \rangle_{\textrm{trials}}
\end{aligned}$$

From this expression, we see that if we select trials according to the
probability distribution $p(\mathbf{r}^N) = p(\mathbf{r}^N)_{NVT}$, then
we get:

$$\langle Y \rangle_{NVT}  = \langle Y \rangle_{\textrm{trials}} \label{ensemble_average_mc}$$

Thus, we choose configurations in our ensemble according to the
canonical ensemble probability distribution, in which case the
ensemble-average value of $Y$ can be estimated by sampling
configurations according to their Boltzmann weight. Finally, we note
that we just need to know the probability of sampling a configuration -
we do not necessarily need an expression for the partition function
itself.


Our problem then boils down to: how do we select states according to the
correct probability distribution without knowing the value of the
partition function?


## Markov chains

To do so, we will generate a

```{glossary}
[Markov chain of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
    a sequence of states that is determined one step at a time based upon
    the probability moving from one state to another
```

A Markov chain satisfies the following two conditions:

-   Each state generated belongs to a finite set of possible outcomes
    called the _state space_. The statistical mechanical analogue to this
    statement is to say that each microstate generated belongs to a
    finite ensemble. We can denote each possible state by
    $\mathbf{r}_1^N, \mathbf{r}_2^N, \mathbf{r}_3^N, \dots$ for the
    enormous set of possible microstates within the canonical ensemble
    that we are sampling. For the canonical ensemble, this state space
    is equal to $V^N$, the accessible phase space.

-   The probability of sampling state $i+1$ in the sequence of states
    sampled depends only on state $i$, and not on previous states in the
    chain.

Since the likelihood of sampling a new state is only related to what
current state we are in, we can define a transition probability,
$\Pi(m\rightarrow n)$, which defines the likelihood of transitioning
from state $m$ to state $n$. We can then imagine an algorithm in which
we start in some state $m$ then transition to a new state $n$ with a
probability given by $\Pi(m\rightarrow n)$ and repeat this for a large
number of trials.

![image](figs/fig_11_1-01.png)

If we do this an infinite number of times, then the
state $m$ will appear with an overall probability given by $p(m)$, where
$p(m)$ is the *limiting* probability distribution that does not depend
on any of the other states (unlike the transition probability). When
sampling from the canonical ensemble, then, we want $p(m)$ to equal
$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)_{NVT}$ - that is, the likelihood of sampling state
$m$ if we take enough states from our Markov chain is equal to the
probability of sampling that state according to the canonical ensemble
distribution function. Thus, we need to find an expression for the
transition probability, $\Pi$, that yields this correct limiting
distribution.


## Detailed balance

At equilibrium, the probability of finding the system in a configuration
$\mathbf{r}_m^N$ must be stationary, meaning that the probability
distribution of the canonical ensemble is invariant with time (this is a
consequence of ergodicity) and is equal to the limiting distribution of
our Markov chain. If we think about a Markov chain as a very large
sequence of states, then for the probability of a particular state to be
stationary, the number of transitions into that state must be the same
as the number of transitions out of it.

Think of this like a mass
balance in transport - the flux into a particular state is equal to the
flux out of it, otherwise we would "accumulate" probability for that
state. Therefore, it must be the case that in any given Markov chain the
number of trials that generate new states from a particular state must
be equal to the total number of trials from all other states that
generate the original configuration.

If we write the probability of
transitioning from some configuration $\mathbf{r}_m^N$ to
$\mathbf{r}_n^N$ as $\Pi(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$ and
the probability of being in state $\mathbf{r}_m^N$ as
$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)$, then we can fulfill the condition that
$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)$ is stationary by imposing the condition of

```{glossary}
detailed balance
    $$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \Pi(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) = p(\mathbf{r}_n^N) \Pi(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N)$$
```

We can rearrange this expression to write:

$$\frac{p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)}{p(\mathbf{r}_n^N)}  = \frac{ \Pi(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N)}{\Pi(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)}$$

Writing detailed balance in this form more clearly shows the consequence
of this definition - if the probability of state $m$,
$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)$, is 10 times larger than the probability of state
$n$, then this expression says that there will be 10 times more
transitions from state $n$ to $m$ than transitions from $m$ to $n$,
agreeing with expectations. Enforcing this condition for all possible
pairs of states guarantees that the number of transitions into and out
of each state is equal if an infinite number of transitions are
attempted (detailed balance is actually an overly stringent criterion -
we could achieve the same properties while enforcing a less stringent
relationship between transition probabilities, but that is outside the
scope of this class).

If a system obeys detailed balance, then the Markov chain must reach a
stationary probability distribution which is necessarily true for any
equilibrium system.

## The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
Having defined the principle of detailed balance, we
can now apply this to a particular Markov chain that samples states
within the canonical ensemble by following the

```{glossary}
[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)
    Also known as the "Metropolis algorithm". An algorithm that samples
    states using acceptance criteria based upon transition probabilities.
```

The key aspect of the Metropolis algorithm is to further divide the
transition probability,
$\Pi(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$, into two terms - the
probability of generating a new trial state,
$g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$, and the probability of
accepting the new trial state,
$\alpha (\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$:

$$\Pi(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) = g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) \alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$$

```{admonition} Show that, in the canonical ensemble, $\frac{\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)}{\alpha(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N)} = \exp \left \{ -\beta \left [ E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ] \right \}$.
<details><summary> Show derivation </summary>

Given the preceding definition, the equation for detailed balance can then be rewritten as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) \alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)}{g(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N) \alpha(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N )} &= \frac{p(\mathbf{r}_n^N)}{p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)}
\end{aligned}$$

Now, we can connect this expression explicitly to the canonical
ensemble. In the canonical ensemble, the probability of finding a
particular state $m$ is related to that state's Boltzmann weight, so we
can write:

$$p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)_{NVT} = \frac{\exp \left [ -\beta E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ]}{Z}$$

Next, we assume that the probability $g$ for generating trial moves is
symmetric, and then write that
$g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) = g(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N)$.
We can assume this because in general we can **arbitrarily** choose a
function for $g$ as long as the detailed balance condition is satisfied.
Combining these expressions, we then write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) \alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)}{g(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N) \alpha(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N )} &= \frac{p(\mathbf{r}_n^N)_{NVT}}{p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)_{NVT}} \\
\frac{\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)}{\alpha(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N)} &= \exp \left \{ -\beta \left [ E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ] \right \}
\end{aligned}$$
</details>
```

This equation stipulates the conditions on the
acceptance condition,
$\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$, that leads to
correct Boltzmann-weighted sampling of configurations in the canonical
ensemble. Importantly, the partition function drops out of this
expression, resolving the issue of being unable to calculate the
partition function explicitly. In principle, several choices of the
acceptance condition could fulfill the conditions imposed detailed
balance; the choice used in the original derivation of the Metropolis
algorithm is:

```{math}
:label: app_a_acceptance
\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) = \text{min} \left ( 1, \exp \left \{ -\beta \left [ E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ] \right \} \right )
```

which fulfills our earlier condition.. This is apparent if we consider
the case where $p(\mathbf{r}_n^N) < p(\mathbf{r}_m^N)$, then:

-   $E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) > 0$

-   $\exp \left \{ -\beta \left [ E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ] \right \} < 1$

-   $\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N) = \exp \left \{ -\beta \left [ E(\mathbf{r}_n^N) - E(\mathbf{r}_m^N) \right ] \right \}$

-   $\alpha(\mathbf{r}_n^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m^N) = 1$

```{admonition} If the proposed state has a lower energy than our current one, what is the probability we will accept the transition move?
<details><summary> Click for answer </summary>

    The probability is 1. All transitions in which the system energy is lowered are automatically accepted.
</details>
```

It is possible for
the system to stay in the same state; that is:

$$\Pi(\mathbf{r}_m \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_m) = 1 - \sum_{n\ne m} \Pi(\mathbf{r}_m \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n)$$

Any given Markov chain generated using the Metropolis Monte Carlo
algorithm can thus have many consecutive identical states, particularly
if the system reaches a local energy minimum.

Based on this derivation, the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm for
correctly sampling states from the canonical ensemble consists of the
following steps (given in [Problem Set 2](../../problems/ps_2/problem_set_2)):

1.  Assume the system is in a configuration, $\mathbf{r}_m^N$, which is
    state $i$ in a Markov chain.

2.  Generate a trial configuration $\mathbf{r}_n^N$ according to the
    probability $g(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}^N_n)$. There
    can be many possible ways of generating trial configurations (or
    many "moves"), as noted below.

3.  Calculate the energy difference between the new and old
    configurations and calculate the probability of transitioning to the
    new state, $\alpha(\mathbf{r}_m^N \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_n^N)$
    according to Eq. {eq}`app_a_acceptance`.

4.  Generate a uniform random number in the range \[0, 1\]. If the
    random number is less than the transition probability, then state
    $i +1$ in the Markov chain has the new configuration
    $\mathbf{r}_n^N$ and the system configuration is updated; that is,
    the new trial move is *accepted*. If the random number is greater
    than the transition probability, then state $i+1$ in the Markov
    chain has the old configuration ($\mathbf{r}_m^N$), the system
    configuration remain the same, and the move is rejected. This step
    is the stochastic implementation of Eq.{eq}`app_a_acceptance`. 

5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until a sufficient number of states in the Markov
    chain are generated.

6.  Approximate the ensemble-average value of some observable
    $Y(\mathbf{r}^N)$ by averaging over all states in the Markov chain.
    Note that many states will be repeated, and we include consecutive
    identical states (which appear when moves are rejected). Averaging
    over all states in the Markov chain then calculates
    $\langle Y(\mathbf{r}^N)\rangle_{NVT}$.

Metropolis Monte Carlo has several advantages. First, the acceptance
ratio only relies on the energies of the two states, and as a result the
rule for generating trials moves with a probability given by $g$ can be
arbitrary and does not have to be physically meaningful. For example,
typical trial moves in a system consisting of a series of liquid-like
particles could be the slight displacement of a single particle, the
rotation of an entire molecule, the displacement of several particles
simultaneously, or non-physical moves such as "hopping" a particle from
one side of the system to the other.

This feature also means that
many-body potentials can be easily used to calculate system energies,
which is more difficult to do in molecular dynamics simulations that
require pair potentials. In addition, because all configurations are
sampled according to their equilibrium probability distributions,
averaging observables over simulation configurations generates ensemble
averages. The downside, however, is that the algorithm is only useful
for calculating equilibrium thermodynamic properties and not observing
system kinetics.

Some care has to be taken in computing ensemble-average quantities. One
choice that can affect values is the starting configuration. If an
initial configuration is generated that is a high energy (and thus
unlikely) state, then it may contribute to a large degree to a resulting
ensemble average even if its actual Boltzmann weight is low. In other
words, imagine a chain with only 10 states; the initial state will
contribute to 1/10 of the ensemble-average even if it should actually
contribute to a much smaller degree. As a result, it is typical to run a
MC algorithm for an initial period of steps that are treated as an
"equilibration" period so that any unphysical, high energy starting
configuration relaxes to a set of low-energy configurations. Inspection
of the MC equations indeed shows that there should generally be a
decrease in the system energy until a set of configurations with similar
low-energy values are obtained.
