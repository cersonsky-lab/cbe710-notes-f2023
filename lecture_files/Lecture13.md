## Importance of liquid structure

We have now outlined the algorithms underlying the Monte Carlo and
Molecular Dynamics techniques and identified methods for sampling from
the {term}`canonical ensemble`, which is an appropriate ensemble for many
systems. We have emphasized the point that during these simulations it
is important to sample some simulation observable, then by proper
averaging at the conclusion of a simulation we can gain some insight
into the behavior of our system. Previous observables we have discussed
included the temperature and energy. In this lecture, we will describe a
different observable that is related to the structure of a set of
particles, which will both give important information about the phase of
the system being studied as well as its thermodynamic properties.

Consider a set of particles that we want to classify as being gas-like,
liquid-like, or solid-like. One thing we know about these different
phases is that their spatial arrangement of particles is dramatically
different. In a solid, particles tend to be clustered very near to each
other in their crystalline arrangements, while in a gas they tend to
spread far apart. A liquid falls somewhere in between, where particles
are condensed but lack the ordered structure inherent to solids. Knowing
this, we can interpret the structure of a liquid by looking at the
*relative* positions of two particles. That is, if particles tend to be
near each other, they are more solid-like; particles that have no
preference for being close to each other are more gas-like. We can
quantify this thinking by studying the {term}`radial distribution function`
as we will now discuss.

## Reduced configurational distribution

First, let us again show that we can ground this discussion in the study
of statistical mechanics, assuming that any given fluid system of
interest can be treated as at constant $NVT$ (we could generalize to
$NPT$ without much difficulty). Recall that we can write the {term}`canonical
partition function` for a classical fluid using the notation:

$$Z = \int_{V^N} d\textbf{r}^N \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}^N)\right]$$

This expression integrates over all possible particle configurations in
a continuous space with phase space volume $V^N$, representing all
possible *combinations* of positions. Here, we let $E(\textbf{r}^N)$
refer to only the potential energy of the system associated with
particle-particle interactions and ignore the kinetic energy
contribution due to particle velocities, as we have noted previously
that velocities are only a function of the temperature and not particle
positions. Alternatively, we can also write this integral by breaking up
$\textbf{r}^N$ into each of the $N$ different position vectors for the
different particles.

$$Z = \int_V d\textbf{r}_1 \int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N  \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2, \textbf{r}_3, \dots \textbf{r}_N )\right]$$

Here, subscripts indicate the index of one particular particle. Using
either notation, the probability of finding the system in some
configuration $\textbf{r}^N$ is the

```{glossary}
configurational distribution

    $$\begin{aligned}
    p(\textbf{r}^N) &= \frac{\exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}^N)\right]}{\int_{V^N} d\textbf{r}^N \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}^N)\right]} \\
     &= \frac{\exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2, \textbf{r}_3, \dots \textbf{r}_N )\right]}{\int_V d\textbf{r}_1 \int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N  \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2, \textbf{r}_3, \dots \textbf{r}_N )\right]}
    \end{aligned}$$
```

Again, this is technically a probability density function, like
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and is the probability of observing
the system in a small volume of phase space near $\textbf{r}^N$; it has
units of volume$^{-N}$ as a result since $\textbf{r}^N$ has units of
$V^N$.

Now, let's consider a different question. Rather than asking the
probability of a particular configuration of particles, let's ask the
probability that particle 1 is at position $\textbf{r}_1$. Recall that
back in our derivation of the canonical ensemble, we divided a combined
system into a small system of interest and a bath, and we said that the
probability that the bath obtains a microstate is proportional to the
number of equivalent bath states. We can use the same idea here, and say
that the probability of a configuration in which a **specific** particle
has some particular position is given by integrating the probability of
a system configuration over all **other** particle positions. In other
words, we can write the:

```{glossary}
reduced configurational distribution

    $$\begin{aligned}
    p(\textbf{r}_1) &= \frac{ \int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N  \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2, \textbf{r}_3, \dots \textbf{r}_N )\right]}{Z} \\
    &=  \int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)
    \end{aligned}$$
```

What this expression says is that we fix the position of particle 1 at
$\textbf{r}_1$, then we integrate the probability density function over
the rest of the phase space where the other particle positions can
obtain any value. We are now asking the probability
of being in one specific region of phase space (i.e., the region where
the position of particle 1 is fixed). This expression assumes that there
is a particular particle with index 1 at position $\textbf{r}_1$.
Alternatively, we could insead calculate the probability that **any** of
$N$ identical particles is at position $\textbf{r}_1$ as opposed to a
specific tagged particle. Since the particles are identical, this
probability is just $N$ times larger, leading to the:

```{glossary}
generic reduced configurational distribution

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1) &= Np(\textbf{r}_1)\\
    &=  N\int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)
    \end{aligned}$$
```
Here, **any** particle
can occupy position $\textbf{r}_1$. Let's extend this concept to
multiple positions. Now, we can calculate the probability that *any*
particle is at position $\textbf{r}_1$ and *any* particle is at position
$\textbf{r}_2$. Again, we fix these positions, then integrate over the
positions of all other particles. We recognize that there are $N$ ways
to choose the first particle and $N-1$ ways to choose the second. Our
expression is then:

$$\begin{aligned}
\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) = N(N-1)  \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)
\end{aligned}$$

We could continue to generalize this notation, but there is no need for
our present purposes.

## The radial distribution function

Let's consider simplifying these two reduced configurational
distribution functions for a system consisting of a homogeneous,
isotropic fluid. That is, assume the fluid is uniform spatially - the
properties of the system are unchanged if I look in any direction
through the fluid. Equivalently, an isotropic fluid can be thought of as
one in which translating/rotating all particle positions does not
influence the probability of a configuration; an anisotropic fluid would
be one in which such manipulations would change the system energy (e.g.
due to interactions with system boundaries). First, consider the
expression:

$$p(\textbf{r}_1) =  \int_V d\textbf{r}_2 \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)$$

This expression is the probability density function for finding a
particle in some small volume, $dV$, centered at some position
$\textbf{r}_1$. Since the particle *has* to be within the volume, then
the probability density function is normalized such that:

$$\int_V p(\textbf{r}_1) d \textbf{r}_1 = 1$$

That is, the probability when summed over all possiblve values of
$\textbf{r}_1$ within the volume has to be one. For an isotropic fluid,
there will be an **equal** likelihood that we can find a single particle
at **any** position in the volume since we are integrating over the
positions of all other particles - there is no reason why any one
position should be favored over another. Therefore, the normalization
condition enforces that $p(\textbf{r}_1) = 1/V$, indicating an equal
likelihood of finding a particular particle anywhere in the volume. The
{term}`generic reduced configurational distribution` for a single particle is
then:

$$\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1) =N p(\textbf{r}_1)  = \frac{N}{V} \equiv \rho$$

Here, $\rho$ is simply the number density of the system. Thus, the
density of the system tells us the probability of finding a particle in
any given small volume of the system independent of the positions of its
neighbors.

Now let's consider the {term}`reduced configurational distribution` for two
particles:

$$\begin{aligned}
\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) = N(N-1)  \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)
\end{aligned}$$

Unlike the former case of studying only a single particle, now there are
possible **correlations** between particles. That is, certain pairs of
positions may be more likely than others due to the interaction of
particle 1 and 2, even when integrating over the positions of all other
particles. Let's first assume that the particles in our system are
completely uncorrelated because they do not interact; that is, we have
an ideal gas. In that case, the probability
$p(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)$ can be factorized into two
single-particle probability distributions since the two particles are
independent of each other. We can then write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) &= N(N-1)  \int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N) \\
&= N(N-1) p(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) \\
&= N(N-1) p(\textbf{r}_1) p(\textbf{r}_2) \quad \text{if positions are independent/uncorrelated}\\
&= \frac{N(N-1)}{V^2} \\
&\approx \rho^2
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we assume that $N\gg1$ for a typical system and approximate this
joint probability distribution function as the density squared. This
result is true for an ideal gas, but in general a real system will have
some deviation from ideality that emerges from interactions between
pairs of particles. We will define a function,
$g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)$, as the:

```{glossary}
pair-correlation function

    $$\begin{aligned}
    g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) &= \frac{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)}{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)_{\textrm{ideal}}} \\
    &= \frac{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)}{\rho^2}
    \end{aligned}$$
```

This expression reflects the tendency for pairs of particles to be distributed at
certain positions relative to each other with probabilities that deviate
from what would be expected for an ideal gas. The expression would be 1
for all pairs of positions for an ideal gas. For completeness we can
rewrite this as:

$$\begin{aligned}
g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) &= \frac{N(N-1)\int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N p(\textbf{r}^N)}{\rho^2} \\
&= \frac{N(N-1)}{\rho^2} \frac{\int_V d\textbf{r}_3 \dots \int_V d\textbf{r}_N \exp \left [-\beta E(\textbf{r}^N)\right]}{Z} 
\end{aligned}$$

This expression will be useful in the next lecture. For an isotropic
system, $g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)$ only depends on the distance
between two particles, $r = |\textbf{r}_1-\textbf{r}_2|$. Again, this is
because all directions in an isotropic fluid are equivalent, so if we
rotate the entire system there is no change in the probability.
Equivalently, I can imagine placing particle 1 at some position, then
placing particle 2 a distance $r$ away - rotating the entire system,
including particle 2, while preserving the same distance $r$ does not
change the system properties. For an isotropic system we can then write
the pair-correlation function as the

```{glossary}
radial distribution function

    $$\begin{aligned}
    g(r) \equiv g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) 
    \end{aligned}$$
```

where $r$ is the scalar distance between particles at position
$\textbf{r}_1$ and $\textbf{r}_2$. 

If we assume that one of these particles is always at the origin of the
coordinate system, and we know that the probability of that particle
being at the origin is $\rho$ since that is the single-particle reduced
distribution function, then we arrive at the result:

$$\begin{aligned}
g(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2) = g(r) &= \frac{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2)}{\rho^2}\\
&= \frac{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1=0)\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1=0, r)}{\rho^2}\\
\therefore g(r) &= \frac{\tilde{p}(\textbf{r}_1=0, r)}{\rho}
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we write the conditional probability density that any particle is
at a distance $r$ away from any particle placed at the origin. Hence we
finally achieve the following definition: for a given particle $i$ in a
system, which we will say is "tagged" and placed at the origin of the
coordinate system, the radial distribution function tells us the
probability of a particle being a distance $r$ away from the tagged
particle relative to what would be observed in an ideal gas.
Alternatively, we could say that the quantity $\rho g(r)$ tells us the
**average number density** of particles at a distance $r$ away from a
single tagged particle. This last definition is probably the most
intuitive.

## $g(r)$ for different states of matter

Having defined $g(r)$, let's qualitatively discuss how it should behave.
As we said, for an ideal gas, the radial distribution function should be
exactly 1 for all distances $r$ between a tagged particle and any other
given particle on average. For a real gas, then, the average density
will approach the overall density at far distances, but $g(r)$ will be
zero for distances less than the diameter of each gas particle - that
is, real gases exclude volume. There is also like some enhanced average
density at close distances between particles, reflecting some weak
attractive intermolecular interactions. For solids, in which atoms are
in very precise spatial positions, $g(r)$ will have sharp peaks
reflecting the typical distances between atoms in crystalline materials.
Finally, for liquids, $g(r)$ will fluctuate around the bulk density,
with high density regions reflecting so-called solvation shells where
atoms prefer to accumulate due to favorable interactions. Thus,
calculating $g(r)$ alone can tell us structural information, such as the
preferred distances between particles. Moreover, we can derive a series
of other thermodynamic properties from this expression, one of which
will be discussed below. First, however, let us discuss how to calculate
this quantity in a simulation.

![image](figs/fig_13_2-01.png)

## Calculating $g(r)$

Let's now talk about how to algorithmically calculate $g(r)$ based on
our above discussion. In principle, $g(r)$ is a continuous quantity, but
in a MD simulation we discretize space. Therefore, we can calculate
$g(r)$ by populating a histogram of pairwise distances and normalizing
appropriately. We divide the distance, $r$, into a set of bins of width
$dr$ that discretizes the distance coordinate. We can number the bins
such that bin $i$ refers to the set of distances between $dr \times i$
and $dr \times (i+1)$. Each bin then refers to a volume of space given
by $\frac{4\pi}{3}dr^3[(i+1)^3 - (i^3)]$.

Recalling that our definition of $g(r)$ is the average density of
particles a given distance $r$ apart divided by the overall density, we
can write the following algorithm:

1.  During a converged simulation, periodically iterate over all
    particles. For each particle, calculate the distance $r$ to every
    other particle.

2.  For each distance, calculate the corresponding index of the bin in
    the histogram; that is, calculate $r/dr$ and round to an integer (or
    round down, depending on how you define your bins). Increase the
    value of this bin by 1.

3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 a number of times during a simulation (i.e.,
    every time you save the energy after convergence).

4.  Normalize the histogram at the end of the simulation. This requires
    dividing each bin by the number of samples (to time average), the
    number of particles in the system (since we iterate over all
    particles each timestep), and the volume of the bin (to get a
    density). Finally, divide all bins by the bulk density ($N/V$) to
    get $g(r)$.

Symbolically, this procedure can be written as:

$$g(r) =  \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{1}{N} \frac{1}{V(r)} \left \langle \sum_i^N \sum_{j\ne i}^N \delta (r-r_{ij}) \right \rangle$$

The function $\delta(r-r_{ij})$ is a delta function that returns 1 if
the distance is within the small bin width of $dr$ around the desired
distance $r$; this is captured by incrementing bins in our histogram.
The ensemble-average of this sum is equal to averaging over the number
of samples (i.e., time-averaging). The term $1/V(r)$ normalizes each bin
by its volume to get an average density per bin. The term $1/N$
normalizes the sum by the number of particles, since we iterate over all
particles each time we sample. Finally, $1/\rho$ normalizes $g(r)$ by
the bulk density as desired. Calculating this for each value of $r$
would yield a complete $g(r)$ curve.
