## Defining the Ising model

We finished our derivation of the ideal gas
partition function and used it to derive well-known thermodynamic
expressions (such as the ideal gas of equation of state). We also
derived a {term}`Langmuir adsorption isotherm` following a similar procedure. In
both of these cases, we neglected *interactions* between molecules. The
approximation that molecules do not interact is severely limiting and
makes it impossible to analyze most condensed phase systems, such as
liquids, or examine phase transitions, which fundamentally depend on the
strength of intermolecular interactions.

In general, studying particles
with interactions is very challenging, leading to very few problems for
which exact analytical solutions exist. This difficulty emerges because
interactions between particles lead to *correlations* between particle
configurations; the partition function can no longer be factorized into
independent single-particle partition functions because the energy of
one particle depends on the configuration of the others. In this
lecture, we will focus on a simple type of lattice model - resembling
lattice models we have treated previously - to illustrate how
interactions affect many-body systems and to introduce a common
approximation for studying these systems.

The system we will consider consists of a set of $N$ magnetic spins
placed on a lattice, to represent a magnetic system. The lattice can be
of various dimensions and geometries (e.g. 2D square or hexagonal). Each
spin can either be up or down; we denote the value of spin $i$ as
$s_i = 1$ for spin up and $s_i = -1$ for spin down. The lattice may also
be in the presence of magnetic field, $H$, that tends to align spins
with the field. The energy of a single configuration of this system is:

```{math}
:label: eq8.2
E_\nu = -\sum_i^N \mu H s_i + (\text{energy due to interactions between spins})
```

$\mu$ is the magnetic moment (not to be confused with the chemical
potential). Each microstate of the system refers to a particular set of
spins - that is a set of values of $s_1=\pm 1, s_2=\pm 1\dots$, which we
will denote as $\{s_i\}$. In Problem Sets [1](../../problems/ps_1/problem_set_1.md) and [2](../../problems/ps_2/problem_set_2.md), we already looked at
the behavior of a system of *non-interacting* spins in which the latter
term in Eq. {eq}`eq8.2` is ignored. Here, we will consider what happens when we incorporate
these interactions.

A simple model for the interaction energy is to assume that only
nearest-neighbor spins on the lattice interact, and that this
interaction can be described by a coupling constant $J$. A **pair** of
spins contributes energy $-J$ to the system if they are aligned, and a
pair of spins contributes energy $J$ to the system if they are
oppositely aligned. The total energy of the system is then:

$$E_\nu = -\sum_i^N \mu H s_i - \frac{J}{2} \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j\label{eq8.3}$$

Here, $\sum_i$ runs over all spins, while $\sum_j^\prime$ is only over
the nearest-neighbor spins of spin $i$, indicated by the $\prime$
symbol. The negative sign in front of the $J$ is because the product of
$s_i s_j$ is positive for aligned spins, but the energy between aligned
spins is negative. Because the outer sum runs over all spins while the
inner sum runs over all neighbors, the interaction between spin $i$ and
$j$ will be counted twice - once when considering the neighbors of spin
$i$, and once when considering the neighbors of spin $j$. We divide by 2
to remove this overcounting of interactions (this is often a confusing
point that is neglected by some authors in their treatment of this
model). The total magnetization is:

$$M_\nu  = \sum_i^N \mu s_i$$

This expression for the energy of a set of spins on a lattice is
referred to as

```{glossary}
[Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model)

    interactions by assuming that the alignment of neighboring spins
    on a 2D lattice contributes to the total energy.

## Magnetic states and spontaneous magnetization
A particular quantity of interest
for magnetic systems is the ensemble-average magnetization,
$\langle M \rangle$. In the problem sets, we studied $\langle M \rangle$
as a function of the external field, $H$, but a system can also exhibit
**spontaneous magnetization** if $\langle M \rangle \ne 0$ in the
absence of a field ($H = 0$).

The spontaneous magnetization of the Ising
model is determined by the value of the coupling constant, $J$. If
$J > 0$, then at equilibrium the lowest-energy configuration would lead
to the alignment of all spins and there would be a finite magnetization
in the absence of a field. We call this system **ferromagnetic**.
Conversely, if $J < 0$ and spins align in alternating orientations, the
spins would be ordered but there would be no net magnetization. We call
this system **antiferromagnetic**. Finally, if $J=0$ and spins are
randomly oriented in the absence of a field, we call the system
**paramagnetic**. This case is the non-interacting case studied in the
problem sets.

```{admonition} Does aligning the spins increase or decrease the entropy of the system?

<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Aligning spins reduces the {term}`entropy` of the system. For
example, consider a case when $J \gg 0$ and all spins are in the same
direction. The system can only have two possible microstates - all spins
are up, or all spins are down. In contrast, a disordered alignment of
spins would have many more possible configurations.

```

There is thus a trade-off between entropy and energy in systems for which $J\ne 0$.
Consider a ferromagnetic system ($J>0$) at constant $NVT$, with $H=0$
and finite $T$. At equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy of this system
must be at a minimum. Writing $F=E-TS$, the system can switch between a
low energy state, in which spins align due to the positive value of $J$,
or a high entropy state, where spins are randomly aligned.

```{glossary}
order-disorder transition
    a phenomenom in a thermodynamic system wherein the system spontaneously
    switches from having order to having none, or vice versa

Curie-temperature
    the temperature at which an order-disorder transition occurs in magnetic
    systems
```

Therefore,
there should be a temperature at which there is an {term}`order-disorder
transition` and the magnetization changes from zero (at high
temperature) to a non-zero value (at low temperature) due to the
energetic interactions between spins. This transition pccurs at the **Curie temperature**, $T_C$,
for this magnetic system, and will now study its origin.

However, it is
important to note that while we are strictly deriving this
order-disorder transition temperature for a magnetic system, this
transition is analogous to phase transitions in other systems, such as
the liquid-gas phase transition. For example, instead of treating a
series of spins that are up or down, we could use the Ising model to
represent a series of particles that are of one type or another (*e.g.*,
to represent the mixing of two types of liquid-phase molecules; this is
called the lattice gas model) which would lead to similar behavior.

## Computing thermodynamic variables of the Ising model

To determine the Curie temperature, we need to relate the
ensemble-average magnetization of the system to the temperature. As our
system can be described by the canonical ensemble (if we include the
magnetic work term as part of the energy function, as done above), our
first step will be write an expression for the canonical partition
function. Using the expression for the energy, the canonical partition
function for the Ising model is:

```{admonition} $ Z = \sum_{s_1=\pm 1} \sum_{s_2=\pm 1} \dots \sum_{s_N =\pm 1}\exp \left (\beta \sum_i^N \mu H s_i + \beta \frac{J}{2}  \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j \right )$
<details><summary> Show derivation </summary>

$$\begin{aligned}
Z &= \sum_{\nu} \exp\left (-\beta E_\nu \right )\\
&= \sum_{\nu}\exp \left (\beta \sum_i^N \mu H s_i + \beta \frac{J}{2}  \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j \right ) \\
&= \sum_{s_1=\pm 1} \sum_{s_2=\pm 1} \dots \sum_{s_N =\pm 1}\exp \left (\beta \sum_i^N \mu H s_i + \beta \frac{J}{2}  \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j \right )
\end{aligned}$$
</details>
```

The last expression explicitly sums over all possible configurations of
the $\{s_i\}$, where for each set of spins the energy is defined by
summing over that set. This partition function is much more complex than
the versions we've seen to date since we cannot factorize it in any
obvious way due to interactions between spins. It should thus be
apparent why systems with interactions are challenging to solve
analytically.
