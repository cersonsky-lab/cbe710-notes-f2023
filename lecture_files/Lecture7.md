## Goals for today's lecture
- Derive the fraction of absorbed sites on a surface solely based on the pressure of the surrounding gas and the binding energy.

## The Langmuir Isotherm
The [previous lecture](Lecture7.md) shows that statistical mechanics can reproduce
classical thermodynamic relationships from first-principles. We will now
test a second example of the three-step approach for studying
independent particles by deriving the **Langmuir adsorption isotherm**.

Consider a system of $N$ ideal gas particles that can adsorb onto a
surface. Physically, this system _could_ represent the adsorption of
reactants onto a catalytic surface. We define the number of
adsorbed particles as $N_a$ and the remaining number of free gas
particles as $N-N_a$. Particles adsorb favorably with an energy of
$-\epsilon_a$ per particle.

To simplify our treatment, we assume all
particles adsorb onto a lattice of discrete with $N_s$ possible binding
sites, of which $N_a$ are occupied assuming that only a single particle
can bind to each site (with $N_s > N_a$, allowing for all particles to
adsorb). All binding sites are assumed to be independent; that is, the
arrangement of particles does not affect the energy of the system. The
quantity we will determine is the fraction of the surface that is
occupied as a function of the pressure of the surrounding gas, $f_a(P)$.

We next have to consider what ensemble to use to solve this problem. We
can think of particles adsorbed to the surface and particles free in the
bulk as two distinct sets of particles such that particles are free to
exchange between the surface and bulk. The number of particles adsorbed
to the surface, $N_a$, is thus allowed to vary. $\langle N_A \rangle$
will be determined at equilibrium which is reached when each particle
adsorbed to the surface has a constant chemical potential, $\mu_a$, that
is equal to the chemical potential of each particle in the bulk,
$\mu_b$.

The surface has $N_s$ potential binding sites; each binding site is
either occupied or not, with the number of occupied sites ($N_a$)
fluctuating. We aim to find an expression for $f_a = \frac{N_a}{N_s}$.
Since $N_a$ can vary, we really seek the ensemble average value of
$N_a$, so that $f_a = \frac{\langle N_a \rangle}{N_s}$.

Since each
binding site is independent and identical, we can factorize the
partition function by treating each site as a subsystem that is either
occupied or unoccupied, meaning that a single particle is adsorbed to
the site or not. Since the sites are spatially distinct, each subsystem
is distinguishable. We then write the grand canonical ensemble partition
function for the whole surface as:

$$\Xi_s = \xi_s^{N_s}$$

where $\xi_s$ is the single-site grand canonical partition function
given as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\xi_s = \sum_{j}e^{-E_j \beta}e^{\mu_a N_j \beta}
\end{aligned}$$

```{admonition} Why are we working with the distinguishable subsystem equation?

Here we are working from the viewpoint of the _sites_ not the _particles_. The _sites_
are distinguishable, whereas the particles are not.

```{admonition} Show that $\Xi_s = \left ( 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} \right )^{N_s}$.

For a single site, there are only two possible values of $N_j$: either
the site is occupied, for which $N_j = 1$, or the site is unoccupied,
for which $N_j = 0$. Similarly, there are only two possible energies: if
$N_j = 1$, $E_j = -\epsilon_a$, and if $N_j = 0$, $E_j = 0$. Therefore
the single-site partition function is:

$$\begin{aligned}
\xi_s &= e^{0 \beta}e^{0 \beta} + e^{-\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} \\
&= 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} \\
\Xi_s &= \xi_s^{N_s}\\
&= \left ( 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} \right )^{N_s}
\end{aligned}$$
</details>
```

Next, we write an expression for the grand potential:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Sigma_G &= - k_B T \ln \Xi_s \\
&= - N_s k_B T \ln \left ( 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} \right )
\end{aligned}$$

```{admonition} Show that $f_a  = \frac{ e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta}}{ 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta}}$.
<details><summary>Show derivation</summary>

We need to relate this thermodynamic potential to the quantity of
interest, $\langle N_a \rangle$. Recall that we can write an expression
for $\Sigma_G$, which is a function of the natural variables
$\mu_a V T$, as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Sigma_G (\mu_a, V, T) &= E(N, V, S) - TS - \mu_a N_a \\
d\Sigma_G &= dE - TdS - SdT - \mu_a d N_a - N_a d \mu_a \\
&= TdS - PdV + \mu_a dN_a - TdS - SdT - \mu_a d N_a - N_a d \mu_a \\
&= -S dT - PdV - N_a d \mu_a
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, we recognize that
$\left ( \frac{\partial \Sigma_G}{\partial \mu_a} \right )_{V,T} = - N_a$,
so:

$$\begin{aligned}
N_a  &= -\left ( \frac{\partial \Sigma_G}{\partial \mu_a} \right )_{V,T} \\
&= \frac{ N_s e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta}}{ 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta} }\\
f_a &= \frac{ N_a }{N_s} \\
&= \frac{ e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta}}{ 1 + e^{\epsilon_a \beta}e^{\mu_a \beta}}
\end{aligned}$$

```

We now have an expression in terms of the chemical potential of the
particles adsorbed to the bulk, but we'd like an expression in terms of
the pressure of the bulk gas. At equilibrium, we know that
$\mu_a = \mu_b$, so we can calculate the chemical potential for
particles in the bulk and relate this to the pressure. Since the gas
molecules are ideal, non-interacting particles, these particles are
described as an ideal gas. As a result, we can substitute in the
expression for the chemical potential derived from the ideal gas
(canonical) partition function in [our previous lecture](Lecture6.md) and use this for the
chemical potential of particles in the bulk:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_b &=  -k_B T \ln \left( \frac{2\pi m k_BT}{h^2}\right )^{3/2} + k_B T \ln \frac{N-N_a}{V} \\
&= -k_B T \ln \left [ \frac{V}{(N-N_a)\lambda^3}\right ]
\end{aligned}$$

Note that we use $\lambda$ (the thermal de Broglie wavelength) to
simplify the notation. We use the ideal gas equation of state
($V = \frac{(N-N_a) k_B T}{P}$) to obtain a pressure dependence:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_b &= -k_B T \ln \left [ \frac{(N-N_a)k_B T}{P(N-N_a)\lambda^3}\right ] \\
&= k_B T \ln \left ( \frac{P\lambda^3}{k_B T}\right )
\end{aligned}$$

Finally, we now require the condition $\mu_a = \mu_b$ to find an
expression for $f_a$. Substituting in the expression for $\mu_b$ to our
prior expression for $f_a$ yields:

$$\begin{aligned}
f_a &=  \frac{ \left ( \frac{P\lambda^3}{k_BT}\right )e^{\epsilon_a \beta}}{1 +  \left ( \frac{P\lambda^3}{k_BT}\right ) e^{\epsilon_a \beta}} \\
&= \frac{P / P_0}{1 +  P / P_0}
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we define
$P_0 = \left ( \frac{k_B T}{\lambda^3}\right )e^{-\epsilon_a / k_BT}$ as
a constant (equal to the pressure for which $f_a = 0.5$) that does not
depend on $f_a$ or on $P$. This expression is our goal - we relate the
pressure to the fraction of occupied sites, $f_a$. We can rearrange this
to equivalently write:

$$f_a = \frac{P}{P + P_0}$$

This last expression is referred to as the

```{glossary}
Langmuir adsorption isotherm
    $f_a = \frac{P}{P + P_0}$; shows that as the pressure of the system increases, the
    surface coverage increases until eventually plateauing.
```

Similar isotherm
behavior is observed in a number of experimental systems. Note also that
by solving for the value $P_0$, which is equivalent to the pressure
where the surface is half-occupied, we can find a value for $\epsilon_a$
or the binding energy if the thermal de Broglie wavelength is known.
Thus, statistical mechanics provides a valuable connection between
microscopic and macroscopic observables relevant to surface occupancy.
