## Mean-field theory

Obtaining a simple expression for the Helmholtz free energy that can be
differentiated to obtain the magnetization _analytically_
from the [Ising model partition function](Lecture8A.md#computing-thermodynamic-variables-of-the-ising-model)
is only possible in a one-dimensional system ([Problem Set 3](../problems/ps_3/problem_set_3)).
It is possible in a two-dimensional
system with significant difficulty (first solved by a Nobel laureate),
and impossible in higher dimensions. Thus, we will instead simplify the
partition function and introduce an approximation that is commonly used
in the study of phase behavior - the **mean-field approximation**, or
the approximation used in mean-field theory.

```{glossary}

    on the particle
```

The idea of {term}`mean-field theory` is to examine a particular particle (for the Ising model, a
single spin) and assume that the surrounding medium (in this case the
other spins) exerts an **average field** which interacts with the tagged
spin of interest. That is, instead of examining interactions with the
specific configuration of neighbors local to that spin, the interactions
are assumed to be equivalent to that of the average configuration of the
medium. The approach thus neglects fluctuations of the medium that are
long-ranged and reduces the many-body problem to an essentially one-body
problem focused on the particle of interest. We will illustrate the
essence of mean-field theory by using it to analytically solve the Ising
model.

Consider again the energy of a single configuration of the Ising model:

$$\begin{aligned}
E_\nu &= -\sum_i^N \mu H s_i - \frac{J}{2} \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j \\
&= -\sum_i^N s_i \left ( \mu H + \frac{J}{2} \sum_j^\prime s_j \right )
\end{aligned}$$

This expression is for the energy of the entire lattice. If, instead, we
consider the energy of a single spin $i$, we could write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_i &= -\mu H s_i - Js_i \sum_j^\prime  s_j \\
&= -\mu s_i \left ( H + \frac{J}{\mu} \sum_j^\prime s_j \right )
\end{aligned}$$

```{admonition} Why did we lose the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$?
<details></summary> Click for answer </summary>
The factor of 1/2 is removed from in front of the sum, since
we are considering the total energy of the single spin in the system,
including all interactions with neighbors (again, often a point of
confusion). We would need to divide the neighbor interaction energy by 2
if summing over the entire lattice.

```

The form of this energy suggests
that we can think of the term $\frac{J}{\mu} \sum_j^\prime s_j$ as a
perturbation to the actual magnetic field, $H$, acting on the spin; we
therefore define $H^\textrm{eff}_i$ as the effective magnetic field that
does work on spin $i$ including this perturbation:

$$\begin{aligned}
H_i^\textrm{eff} &\equiv H + \frac{J}{\mu} \sum_j^\prime s_j
\end{aligned}$$

The single-spin energy is then written as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_i &= -\mu  H^\textrm{eff}_i s_i
\end{aligned}$$

We can now see that the interaction energy with neighboring spins
contributes to the effective field that acts on spin $i$. We can rewrite
the expression for the effective field in terms of the average spin of
the nearest-neighbors to remove the sum:

$$\begin{aligned}
H_i^\textrm{eff}  &= H + \frac{J}{\mu} n \langle s \rangle^\prime_i 
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we define $n$ as the number of nearest-neighbors (i.e. 2 in 1D, 4
in a 2D square lattice, etc.) and $\langle s \rangle ^\prime_i$ is the
average value of the spin of the nearest-neighbors of $s_i$, hence the
$^\prime$. So far, these expressions are all exact.

We now make the mean field assumption, and assume that
$\langle s \rangle ^\prime_i = \langle s \rangle$ - that is, the average
value of the **local** spins (nearest-neighbors) of spin $i$ is equal to
the average value of spins in the **entire** system. The effective field
then becomes:

$$\begin{aligned}
H_i^\textrm{eff}  &= H + \frac{J}{\mu} n \langle s \rangle \equiv H^\textrm{eff}\\
\epsilon_i &= -\mu  H^\textrm{eff} s_i
\end{aligned}$$

These expressions are the essence of mean-field theory - the specific
accounting of interactions with nearest-neighbor spins has been replaced
with an average (mean) interaction, $H^\textrm{eff}$, so that spins are
no longer explicitly coupled. The mean field is identical for each spin and does
not depend on $s_i$.

Correlations between spins are completely captured
in the ensemble-average spin term, which is a property of the state of
the lattice and not a property of a specific spin. We can then use this
expression for the energy of a single spin to solve for the
magnetization. Indeed, we have already done just that on [Problem Sets 1](../problems/ps_1/problem_set_1)
and
[2](../problems/ps_2/problem_set_2), where we solved for the magnetization of a paramagnet in a field
$H$. We can use the exact same formalism but replace $H$ with the
effective field $H^\textrm{eff}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
Z &= z^N \\
z &= \sum_i e^{-\beta \epsilon_i} \\
&= e^{\beta \mu H^\textrm{eff}} + e^{-\beta \mu H^\textrm{eff}} \\
&= 2 \cosh(\beta \mu H^\textrm{eff}) \\
Z &= \left [2 \cosh(\beta \mu H^\textrm{eff})\right] ^N
\end{aligned}$$

We have simply replaced the field $H$ with the effective field
$H^\textrm{eff}$ in these steps. The rest of the derivation proceeds the
same as in the problem sets, allowing us to skip to:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle M \rangle &= N \mu \tanh( \beta \mu H^\textrm{eff}  ) \\
&= N \mu \tanh( \beta \mu H + \beta J n \langle s \rangle  )
\end{aligned}$$

This is the **mean-field approximation** for the total magnetization of
the lattice, $M$, and allows us to determine the magnetization for a set
of **interacting** spins without knowing exact configurations of spins
on the lattice. We can simplify this expression by replacing the
ensemble-average magnetization with the ensemble-average spin via
$\langle s \rangle =\langle M \rangle / N\mu$ to finally get:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle s \rangle &= \tanh( \beta \mu H +  \beta J n \langle s \rangle )
\end{aligned}$$

This equation has $\langle s \rangle$ on both the left hand side and in
the $\tanh$ function. We refer to this type of expression as a

```{glossary}
self-consistent mean-field theory
    a mean-field theory where the a thermodynamically-averaged variable
    depends on itself.
```

... because the mean field which
influences the average value of the magnetization then itself depends on
the average value of the magnetization. This expression now has the
magnetization (i.e., average spin) as a function of the temperature,
external field, lattice (through $n$), and coupling parameter, so we can
solve as a function of temperature to determine the temperature at which
the system transitions from a non-zero to zero magnetization.

For this
type of expression, we can solve for the solution graphically by finding
the intersection between $\langle s \rangle$ and
$\tanh( \beta \mu H +  \beta J n \langle s \rangle )$ if both are
plotted as a function of $\langle s \rangle$. In other techniques, such
as the self-consistent field theory of polymers, similar equations are
solved iteratively by converging onto a result.

Performing this graphical solution method shows the following behavior
in the zero-field ($H=0$) limit. For small values of $\beta J n$, the
only solution is the trivial solution
$\langle s \rangle = \tanh( \beta J n \langle s \rangle ) = 0$. Since
$\beta J n$ is temperature dependent through the $\beta$ parameter, we
recognize that this solution, in which there is no spontaneous
magnetization, is the disordered state. Since $\beta = 1/k_B T$ this
corresponds to a high-temperature state, consistent with our
understanding of the entropically favored disordered state being
preferred at high temperatures. For large values of $\beta J n$, there
are three solutions for $\langle s \rangle$; the trivial solution, and
two symmetric solutions for finite values of $\langle s \rangle$. The
two possible finite values correspond to the ordered, low-temperature
alignment of spins characteristic of a ferromagnetic, with two solutions
possible due to the symmetry of the system. Calculating the free
energies of these solutions would show that the finite solutions are
lower free energy than the trivial solution, confirming that at low
temperatures the system aligns spins. Finally, the crossover between the
low-temperature and high-temperature state occurs at a temperature:

$$T_C = \frac{nJ}{k_B}$$

Thus, the mean field theory predicts an order-disorder transition.
However, it should be noted that this solution is not identical to the
exact solutions - for example, on a 2D square lattice, the analytical
solution predicts $T_C \approx 2.3J/k_B$ which is distinct from the
value of $T_C$ in the mean field model. This error decreases as we go to
higher dimensions, but reflects the approximations within mean-field
theory. More advanced techniques are possible, including "tagging"
multiple spins for simultaneous analysis, but that is beyond the scope
of this class.
