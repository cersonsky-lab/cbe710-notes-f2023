## Goals and questions for today's lecture
- Recap fundamental topics that inform our study of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics
- What are the different approaches for describing matter? How do they differ?

## What is up and down?

A [_sign convention_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_convention) is a general rule to determine what is positive and
negative in contexts where, putatively, up and down are community-defined.
In thermodynamics, we assume that when energy _enters_ a system, its sign
is positive (and conversely, when energy _leaves_ a system, its sign is
negative). When work is done _on_ the system, its sign is positive, whereas
when work is done _by_ the system, its sign is negative.

## Three descriptions of matter

Broadly, we can describe a system and the matter that comprises it using
three different approaches: *i*) thermodynamics, *ii*) statistical
mechanics, and *iii*) quantum mechanics. This class will largely focus
on the former two subjects, although some principles from quantum
mechanics will occasionally be referenced. We will first discuss each
complementary description of matter and provide some insight into the
goals of this class.

### Thermodynamics

[Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)
studies the *macroscopic* properties of systems at
equilibrium. Classical thermodynamics does not require knowledge of the
microscopic details of a system; for example, we might know that a box
contains some amount of gas, but thermodynamic properties do not depend
on knowledge of the precise positions of gas molecules.
Thermodynamics provides a framework that relates macroscopic properties, and their
changes, to one another.
However, thermodynamic relations alone cannot predict the magnitude of these changes,
which require knowledge on *material parameters* that must be empirically determined.
Finally, thermodynamics is based on a set of postulates which are empirically known to hold but cannot be
rigorously proven.
Here is an example of a thermodynamic relation:

```{math}
:label: cv_cp
C_P - C_V = \left [ P + \left ( \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}  \right)_T \right ] \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T}  \right)_P
```

Equation {eq}`cv_cp` relates the difference in the [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity)
at constant pressure ($C_P$) and the heat capacity at constant volume ($C_V$) to the pressure ($P$),
partial derivative of the internal energy $E$ with respect to volume at constant
temperature, and partial derivative of the volume with respect to temperature ($T$)
at constant pressure. No microscopic information is
provided and all quantities are expressed in terms of differential
changes in system properties; the actual *values* of these partial
derivatives and materials parameters must be measured experimentally (or
predicted from knowledge of the molecular properties of a system).

### Statistical mechanics

The weakness - and arguably, power - of thermodynamics is that it
provides no molecular, microscopic description of the system of
consideration, but rather provides universal equations relating
measurable macroscopic properties. Statistical mechanics takes the
opposite approach by *beginning* with a microscopic description of a
system then deriving macroscopic properties.
Using statistical mechanics, we seek to derive the
macroscopic properties of systems at or near equilibrium from a
statistical description of the enormous ($\approx 10^{20}$) number of
particles in a typical macroscopic system. Thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics thus treat the same systems, but the exact,
macroscopic relations provided by thermodynamics can now be complemented
by system-specific quantities calculated from molecular details. In
effect, statistical mechanics answers the question of why **specific**
systems behave in the way that they do - that is, what accounts for the
specific values of macroscopic quantities. This connection between
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics will be highlighted throughout
the course. Here are examples of equations that we will see frequently
throughout this course:

```{math}
:label: canonical_partition
Z(N,V,T) = \sum_i^{\textrm{states}} \exp\left (-\frac{E_i(N, V)}{k_B T}\right)
```

```{math}
:label: thermo_connection
F = - k_B T \ln Z(N,V,T)
```

Equation {eq}`canonical_partition` is the **canonical [partition
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics))**,
one of the key equations that we will discuss. In this
equation, $E_i$ is the energy of a particular microstate - or a specific
configuration of all particles - of the system and the summation
accounts for **all possible microstates** of the system. The number of
microstates can be enormously large. The partition function illustrates
that statistical mechanics deals with particle-specific quantities
(i.e., energies), but takes into account the incredibly large number of
particles and possible particle positions that contribute to the
macroscopic behavior of a system. Equation
{eq}`thermo_connection` illustrates the connection between
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics by writing the Helmholtz free
energy - a macroscopic system parameter - as a function of the canonical
partition function - a microscopic system parameter. This connection
between thermodynamics and statistical quantities will be a major
feature of our studies.

### Quantum mechanics

While statistical mechanics provides a microscopic framework that
thermodynamics does not, this framework still depends on parameters
that describe the behavior and energetics of the atoms and molecules,
such as particle-specific energy levels ($E_i$ in the
partition function above). In principle, this information can be
obtained from quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics defines the set of
possible states for a specific particle,
and relative energy levels of these states, for a
single particle; however, it provides no information on the likelihood
that a particle is found in any such state.

For example, consider [an ideal particle confined within a one-dimensional box](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Physical_Chemistry_(LibreTexts)/03%3A_The_Schrodinger_Equation_and_a_Particle_in_a_Box) with length $L$ by
two walls. We'll say that the potential energy of the particle is zero for any position within the box and infinite elsewhere.

When the box is sufficiently small, quantum mechanics gives an understanding
of _where_ the particle could be found in this box, because not all positions
or energies are equally likely. QM provides the following description of the energy
levels accessible to a single particle that has a single
translational degree of freedom within this box:


```{math}
:label: partbox1d
\epsilon_n = \frac{h^2 n^2}{8mL^2}  \quad n = 1,2, \dots
```

Here, $n$ is a subscript denoting each individual microstate accessible
to the single particle system, $\epsilon$ is the corresponding energy,
$h$ is Planck's constant, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $L$ is
the size of the box. We can plot these discrete energy levels (which
depend quadratically on $n$) as follows:

![image](figs/fig_1_2.png)

The key point to illustrate is that quantum mechanics provides this set
of states and energies which can be used to describe the molecular
properties of a single molecule, and then can be used in conjunction
with tools from statistical mechanics to calculate macroscopic
properties.

**In this course, we will not use quantum mechanics to define
the set of possible $E_i$, but the connection is something to keep in
mind.**

To summarize,
- **Thermodynamics** provides macroscopic relationships between
the properties of a system but requires specific materials parameters as
input.
- **Statistical mechanics** can link macroscopic thermodynamic
observables to the microscopic properties of a material but requires a
description of system energies.
- **Quantum mechanics** can provide the set of
energies accessible to a system but cannot tell us the likelihood with
which such energies are obtained.

In this course we will focus on the
former two topics, but it is all three in conjunction that enable the
analysis of real systems.
