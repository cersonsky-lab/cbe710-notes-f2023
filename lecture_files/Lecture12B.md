## Sampling the canonical ensemble in MD simulations

We have now discussed the basic equations of motion for a MD
simulation, but have not clearly connected to a statistical
ensemble. In Monte Carlo simulations, the statistical ensemble sampled
(i.e., the canonical ensemble) is enforced by choosing configurations
with a probability proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

```{admonition} What statistical ensemble is "default" for basic MD simulations?
<details><summary> Click for answer </summary>

In MD simulations, the statistical ensemble is enforced by the equations of
motion. For basic MD, we integrate Newton's equations of motion, which
are conservative, so the total energy of the system (kinetic + potential
energy) is fixed. As a result, the MD algorithm described in above
samples the {term}`microcanonical ensemble`. This ensemble is perfectly fine for
some systems, such as isolated molecules in the gas phase that are not
in contact with a heat bath.

```

In many problems of interest we
would rather model a system that is at a constant temperature and
samples the {term}`canonical ensemble` since this is more representative of most
physical systems. We thus need to modify our equations of motion to add
a constraint that maintains a constant temperature instead of constant
energy.

We will now seek to derive an algorithm for constant temperature MD
simulations via the implementation of a simulation {term}`thermostat`.
First, however, there is a more fundamental question - how do we define
temperature in a molecular dynamics simulation? Answering this question
will also tie up a loose end from the previous class, namely how we
should initialize the velocities of particles in our system.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

So far in this class, we have dealt solely with potential energy
functions that are a function of particle positions. However, in a
classical simulation, a particle configuration is specified by particle
momenta (i.e., velocities, denoted $\textbf{v}^N$) in addition to particle positions (denoted $\textbf{r}^N$).

The complete energy of the system is then given by both the potential energy,
$P(\textbf{r}^N)$, *and* the kinetic energy, given by $K(\textbf{v}^N)$.
Note an important feature - in general for a conservative Newtonian
system, the potential energy is *only* a function of particle positions,
while the kinetic energy is *only* a function of particle
velocities/momenta. The two contributions are thus separable - i.e.,
their contributions to the partition function can be factorized.

Let's then consider the distribution of molecular velocities associated
with the kinetic energy, $K(\textbf{v}^N)$, since this term in the total
energy is independent of the potential energy term. We can write the kinetic energy
of particle $i$ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
K(\textbf{v}_i) = \frac{1}{2}m\textbf{v}_i \cdot \textbf{v}_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\end{aligned}$$


Here, the speed $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity vector,
$\textbf{v}_i$. Now, we ask the probability that a
particle obtains a particular velocity vector near the point where
$\textbf{v}_i = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$.

Since we are in the
{term}`classical limit` and treat particle coordinates/velocities as a
continuum, we no longer ask the probability of one specific velocity
vector, but rather the probability of finding a velocity within a small
range of velocities. That is, if we think of the space of possible
velocities as a 3D volume with axes $v_x, v_y,$ and $v_z$, then we want
to calculate the probability of finding a particle with a velocity
within an infinitesimal volume $dv_x dv_y dv_z$ centered on
$v_x, v_y, v_z$ in this velocity space. We can write this probability
density (i.e. probability per unit volume) in the {term}`canonical ensemble` as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho(v_x, v_y, v_z) &=\frac{e^{-\beta K(\textbf{v}_i)}}{Z} \\
&= \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_BT }\right ]
\end{aligned}$$

Here, $Z$ is a partition function we calculate by enforcing that the
probability of obtaining a velocity vector in the entire volume of the
velocity space has to be 1:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \frac{1}{Z}\exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_BT }\right ] dv_x dv_y dv_z = 1$$

```{admonition} Show that $Z = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{-3/2}$
<details><summary>Show derivation </summary>

Using $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left [-ax^2\right] = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
Z &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_BT }\right ] dv_x dv_y dv_z\\
  &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_x^2)}{2k_BT }\right ] dv_x\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_y^2)}{2k_BT }\right ] dv_y\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_z^2)}{2k_BT }\right ] dv_z\\
  &= \left(\frac{2\pi k_BT }{m}\right)^{3/2}
\end{aligned}
$$

</details>
```

Our probability density for velocities is then the

```{glossary}
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for velocities

    $$\rho(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{3/2}  \exp\left [ - \frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_BT }\right ]$$
```
This expression tells us that the probability of finding a
particle with a velocity within an infinitesimal volume element
$(dv_x, dv_y, dv_z)$ centered on the vector
$\textbf{v}_i = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$ is given by:

$$p(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \rho(v_x, v_y, v_z) dv_x dv_y dv_z$$

Integrating this expression over a finite volume of interest (in
velocity space) yields the probability of finding a velocity within that
volume. Recall that it is $p$ that is normalized to be 1 across the
entire space, not $\rho$.

There are a few things to note about this distribution. First, each of
component of the velocity vector is independent; that is, we can write:

$$\rho(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \rho(v_x) \rho(v_y) \rho(v_z)$$

and

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho(v_x) &= \rho(v_y) = \rho(v_z) \\
&= \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{1/2}  \exp\left [ - \frac{mv_x^2}{2k_BT }\right ]
\end{aligned}$$

Second, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is strictly only valid at equilibrium, 
because we use the canonical partition function in the derivation.
However, that's the only major assumption we make, other than that
classical mechanics is valid (i.e. we are not moving at relativistic
speeds and there are no strong quantum effects). 

### The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as a Gaussian distribution

If we look at the form of this distribution, we see that it follows a
Gaussian (normal) distribution. Recall that a Gaussian function
generally has the form:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\exp \left [-\frac{1}{2}\left (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right )^2 \right ]$$

where $\sigma^2$ is the variance and $\mu$ is the mean. Comparing this
form with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for a single component of
the velocity vector shows that the variance of the distribution is
$\sigma^2 = \frac{k_B T}{m}$ and the mean is $\mu=0$. These two
quantities tell us that as we increase the temperature of the system,
the mean velocity is always zero, but we are increasingly likely to
sample larger velocities.

In principle, we want to generate velocities such that the
system begins at a particular, well-defined temperature. The
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution then tells us how to do this.
Specifically, for each particle, we can generate three random numbers
drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution at the desired
temperature $T$ to represent each of the three velocity components;
again this is possible because each component is statistically
independent.

In practice, it is worth noting that a property of Gaussian functions is
that if $X$ is normally distributed with a mean $\mu$ and variance
$\sigma^2$, then $Y=aX$ is also normally distributed with mean $a\mu$
and variance $a^2\sigma^2$. Thus, we only need a function that generates
random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a
variance of any number, and we can convert the results of that
distribution to our chosen Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by multiplying
by an appropriate value of $a$. Matlab has a built-in function to do
this, for example.

### Features of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

First, we
can calculate the distribution of speeds as opposed to velocities - that
is, the distribution of $v = \sqrt{\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{v}}$. This
requires an integral in spherical coordinates to represent all possible
vector directions with a final result of:

$$\rho(v) = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{3/2} 4\pi v^2 \exp\left [ - \frac{mv^2}{2k_BT }\right ]$$

Again, recall that this is the probability density (per unit speed,
since we multiply by $dv$ to get the actual probability) of finding the
particle with a speed near $v$, but here $v$ is always positive and is a
scalar quantity. Unlike the velocity distribution, the mean of the speed
distribution is non-zero, and instead we can show that:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle v \rangle &= \int_0^\infty v \rho(v) dv = \sqrt{\frac{8k_BT}{\pi m}}\\
\langle v^2 \rangle &= \int_0^\infty v^2 \rho(v) dv = \frac{3k_BT}{m}
\end{aligned}$$

This means that at higher temperatures the distribution of speeds
broadens and shifts to higher values, indicating that particles move
faster at higher temperatures, as expected.

![image](figs/fig_12_1-01.png)

So note the results we have so far: by assuming a set of particles that
have velocities consistent with the canonical ensemble, we can relate
the ensemble-average value of the speed squared to the temperature.
Relating this last expression to the kinetic energy (for a set of all
$N$ particles) gives:

$$\begin{aligned}
\langle K(\textbf{v}^N) \rangle &= \left \langle \frac{1}{2}Nmv^2 \right \rangle \\
&= \frac{1}{2}Nm \langle v^2 \rangle \\
&= \frac{3}{2}Nk_BT
\end{aligned}$$

This result, that the contribution of each particle to the
ensemble-average kinetic energy is given by $3/2 k_BT$, is exactly the
result obtained from the [equipartition theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem) - each degree of
freedom for the velocity, which is squared in the expression for the
kinetic energy, contributes $1/2 k_BT$ to the corresponding
ensemble-average energy (kinetic energy in this case). 

```{admonition} Say I am simulating the liquid and vapor phases of a system near the phase boundary (i.e., at the same temperature, where both phases are stable). Which system's particles have a higher velocity?
<details><summary> Click for answer </summary>

Because the two systems are at the
same temperature, the distribution of their molecular velocities are the
same, even though we may conventionally think that gas molecules move
"faster" than liquid molecules. In reality, it's that liquid-phase
molecules collide more frequently so that their velocity vectors change
more rapidly, but the distribution of velocities remains the same as a
corresponding vapor-phase system. Of course, typically we also associate
gases with higher temperature phases, in which case our results do
indeed show that their molecular speeds would be faster on average.

## Calculating temperature in a molecular simulation

With the Maxwell-Boltzmann relationship in hand, we can now see a method
to calculate the temperature in a molecular simulation. Specifically, we
have the relation:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}Nm \langle v^2 \rangle  &= \frac{3}{2}Nk_BT
\end{aligned}$$

This expression gives us an operational definition of the temperature;
while strictly we only relate the ensemble-average kinetic energy to the
temperature, we can approximate the temperature as a function of time
by:

$$\begin{aligned}
T(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \frac{m_i v_i(t)^2}{3k_B}
\end{aligned}$$

Using this definition, the temperature will fluctuate for a system at
constant energy (i.e. using standard MD algorithms) and also for a
system at "constant" temperature (i.e. using a thermostat as described
below) since the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy is
only valid in ergodic systems. Thus, if a simulation is run for long
enough at constant temperature such that the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution correctly describes particle speeds, then this relationship
should generate the expected ensemble-average temperature. Note that the
instantaneous temperature is still not rigorously defined - we would say
that the temperature of the system is the ensemble-average temperature,
and the instantaneous temperature is defined only to facilitate
calculations (i.e. to maintain temperature via the thermostat described
below).

## Andersen thermostat

We have now derived the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for particle
velocities in the canonical ensemble, and showed that we could link the
ensemble-average temperature to the ensemble-average kinetic energy as a
means of *defining* the simulation temperature. However, we have yet to
discuss how to actually maintain a well-defined simulation temperature
so that our system samples the canonical ensemble. We will now discuss
this by defining a simulation

```{glossary}
thermostat
    in simulation, an algorithm to conserve the system temperature
```

First, you may immediately realize that if
$T(t) = \sum_i^N \frac{m_i v_i(t)^2}{3k_B N}$, then we can enforce a
constant temperature by just rescaling the velocities every time step.
Velocity rescaling in principle is fine since it does not affect the
relative positions of particles, and hence will not result in unphysical
states (e.g. particles overlapping).

```{admonition} What problems could you see with velocity scaling to maintain constant temperature?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>
The problem with this
approach is that it would eliminate fluctuations in the kinetic energy
and may not capture the correct Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of
particle velocities expected in the canonical ensemble.
</details>
```

Instead, we will
describe an approach called the

```{glossary}
Andersen thermostat
    A simulation thermostat which keeps constant temperature by assuming that particles
    stochastically collide with some particle in the external heat reservoir.
```

In between these collisions,
the system evolves at constant total energy; each collision essentially
ensures that the system samples different possible constant system
energies (i.e. different microcanonical ensembles) with the correct
Boltzmann weight.

An Andersen thermostat is implemented by selecting a set of particles
(or a single particle) stochastically with a frequency given by a
coupling parameter, $\eta$, and resetting their velocities according to
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution; this represents a collision with a
particle in the thermal reservoir. Assuming that collisions are
uncorrelated, the probability with which each particle collides with the
bath at each timestep is given by:

$$p(\Delta t; \eta) = \eta \Delta t$$

This expression is based on the mean number of collisions expected
during an interval $\Delta t$. The collision frequency, $\eta$, is
usually specified in terms of the timestep. It can be shown that this
procedure correctly reproduces properties of a canonical ensemble since
the kinetic energy will sample the correct distribution and the
temperature is only a function of the particle velocities. For example,
the Andersen thermostat will produce the correct Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of velocities and can exactly reproduce Monte Carlo
simulations that sample the canonical ensemble. The coupling parameter
can be tuned and there is not necessarily an optimal value; typical
values are on the order of $\eta = \frac{0.01}{\Delta t}$ to
$\eta = \frac{0.001}{\Delta t}$ so that velocities are not reset too
frequently, which could interfere with measurements of dynamical
behaviors (i.e., the measurement of the diffusion coefficient).

Note that the Andersen thermostat changes the velocities of particles at
time $t$, and hence requires an equation of motion in which velocities
are specified, such as the Velocity Verlet algorithm. An example
algorithm for a MD simulation using the Andersen thermostat then
consists of the following steps:

1.  Choose a starting configuration, $\mathbf{r}^N(t=0)$.

2.  Generate initial particle velocities, $\textbf{v}^N(t=0)$, by
    sampling from the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution at a given
    temperature $T$.

3.  Compute the forces acting on all particles, $\textbf{f}^N(t)$.

4.  Update the positions to time $\textbf{r}^N(t+\Delta t)$.

5.  Update the velocities to $\textbf{v}^N(t+1/2\Delta t)$ according to
    the Velocity-Verlet algorithm.

6.  Calculate the new forces $\textbf{f}^N(t+\Delta t)$.

7.  Finish the velocity update to $\textbf{v}^N(t+\Delta t)$

8.  Iterate over all particles and stochastically attempt to select a
    particle with probability $\eta \Delta t$; if selected, reset the
    particle velocity vector by sampling each component from the
    Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.

9.  Repeat steps 3-8 until a sufficient number of timesteps have
    elapsed. Periodically compute and save the value of some observables
    (e.g., temperature, pressure).

10. Approximate the ensemble-average value of the saved observables by
    averaging over states sampled during a period of time during which
    the system is at equilibrium.

Note again that this algorithm now introduces a stochastic element to
molecular dynamics, unlike the basic MD algorithm which in principle is
deterministic. Finally, it is important to recognize that the Andersen
thermostat is just one simple approach for maintaining the system
temprature, and is no longer commonly used in practice in favor of more
advanced techniques (e.g. the [Nose-Hoover thermostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nos%C3%A9%E2%80%93Hoover_thermostat))
that are considered more reliable.
