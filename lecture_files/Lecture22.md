## Equilibrium conditions

For simple, single-component
systems at equilibrium, certain thermodynamic potentials are either
minimized or maximized depending on the parameters held constant in that
system. We will now expand upon the concept that a system at equilibrium
is stable with respect to variations, then apply this framework to study
conditions of equilibrium in multicomponent systems.

```{admonition} If our system is at stable equilibrium, any changes will ______ the entropy.

Correct! Entropy is *maximized* at equilibrium, so changes will *decrease* the entropy.

We can determine if a given system is at equilibrium by its
response to a small variation in thermodynamic parameters.
Testing such "virtual" variations was effectively the
procedure used in the preceding lecture to illustrate how other
thermodynamic potentials respond at equilibrium. Here, we will formalize
the notation for analyzing the response of a system to small variations;
later, we will consider stability with respect to very large variations
in system parameters.

Consider an isolated system. We will write an expression for the effect
of a small perturbation with respect to a parameter $z_i$ on the
entropy, $\delta \underline{S}$, recognizing that the perturbation is
small. Recall from our [earlier lecture](Lecture20) that
we mentioned that there are $n+2$ independently variable parameters (i.e.
$\underline{U}$,$\underline{V}$, $N_1$, etc.). We will now consider
calculating the change in the entropy, $\Delta \underline{S}$,
associated with a series of small perturbations $\delta z_i$, where
$z_i$ refers to one of the $n+2$ independently variable parameters; if
all the $\delta z_i$ are sufficiently small, we can calculate the change
in entropy by Taylor expanding around the original value of $S$:

$$\Delta \underline{S} = \delta \underline{S} + \frac{1}{2!}  \delta^2 \underline{S} + \frac{1}{3!}  \delta^3 \underline{S} \dots $$
where

$$\delta \underline{S}  = \sum_{i=1}^{n+2} \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{S}}{\partial z_i} \right ) \delta z_i \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{n+2}  \underline{S}_{z_i} \delta z_i$$

and 

$$\delta^2 \underline{S}  = \sum_{i=1}^{n+2} \sum_{j=1}^{n+2} \left ( \frac{\partial^2 \underline{S}}{\partial z_i\partial z_j} \right ) \delta z_i \delta z_j \equiv\sum_{i=1}^{n+2} \sum_{j=1}^{n+2}  \underline{S}_{z_i z_j} \delta z_i  \delta z_j$$

We can continue this framework for higher order derivatives. Here, note
the notation we use, as adopted from the section on {term}`Maxwell
reciprocity` - the subscripts on $\underline{S}$ indicates partial
derivative(s) with respect to the subscripted variable.

At equilibrium, we have now established two conditions that must be true:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \underline{S} &= 0 \\
\delta^2 \underline{S} &< 0
\end{aligned}$$

If I were to plot $\underline{S}$ with respect to all possible $z_i$,
the first condition indicates that there is an extremum
in $\underline{S}$, while the second condition ensures that it is a
maximum, and thus small perturbations to the system will decrease the
entropy.

## Phase equilibrium in multi-component systems

Let us now consider the conditions of equilibrium for a *multiphase*
system; that is, a complex system which can be divided into multiple
simple subsystems representing multiple phases. Each phase has its own
unique properties, but all phases consist of the same components.

For example:
- the liquid state of a molecule is in equilibrium with the vapor phase of the same molecule; in this case the two phases correspond to different states of aggregation and are distinguished by different densities
- a mixture of oil and water that separates into two liquid phases, one of which is primarily oil and the other of which is primarily water; the compositions of each phase are distinct but again the same components exist in each phase.

In general, it will be hard to identify physical "boundaries" to each phase
in a multiphase system; however, we can construct virtual walls that
divides a complex isolated system into multiple subsystems, each of
which represents a different phase.

We will now derive constraints placed on intensive variables of a
multiphase system. Let us consider a general case where a system has two
phases, $(1)$ and $(2)$, and two components, $A$ and $B$. We can imagine
an isolated, complex system that is divided into two simple subsystems,
each corresponding to a phase.

![image](figs/fig_22-1-01.png)

Our subsystems are connected such that
they can exchange heat (and therefore $\underline{U}$),
volume, and material, such that the system is
subject to the following constraints at equilibrium:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \underline{S} &= \delta \underline{S}^{(1)} + \delta \underline{S}^{(2)} = 0\\
\delta \underline{U} &= \delta \underline{U}^{(1)} + \delta \underline{U}^{(2)} = 0\\
\delta \underline{V} &= \delta \underline{V}^{(1)} + \delta \underline{V}^{(2)} = 0 \\
\delta {N_A} &= \delta N_A^{(1)} + \delta N_A^{(2)} =0 \\
\delta {N_B} &= \delta N_B^{(1)} + \delta N_B^{(2)} =0
\end{aligned}$$

Each of these thermodynamic parameters has a corresponding conjugate
variable associated with its individual phase (e.g. $T^{(1)}$ and
$T^{(2)}$). The first constraint is from the condition that the entropy
reaches an extremum at equilibrium as discussed above, while the rest
are due to the boundaries of the isolated system. Using the entropy
representation of the fundamental relation, we can then write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \underline{S} &=  \delta \underline{S}^{(1)} + \delta \underline{S}^{(2)} \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n+2}  \underline{S}^{(1)}_{z_i} \delta z_i  + \sum_{i=1}^{n+2}  \underline{S}^{(2)}_{z_i} \delta z_i  \\
&= \frac{1}{T^{(1)}} \delta \underline{U}^{(1)} + \frac{1}{T^{(2)}} \delta \underline{U}^{(2)} + \frac{P^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}} \delta \underline{V}^{(1)} + \frac{P^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}} \delta \underline{V}^{(2)} - \nonumber \\ &\frac{\mu_A^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}} \delta N_A^{(1)} - \frac{\mu_A^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}} \delta N_A^{(2)} - \frac{\mu_B^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}} \delta N_B^{(1)} - \frac{\mu_B^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}} \delta N_B^{(2)} = 0 
\end{aligned}$$

The important part here is that the variation in the entropy must be
zero with respect to all possible variations - that is, for any
variation in any other parameter. Substituting in the constraints above
gives:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \underline{S} = & \left (\frac{1}{T^{(1)}} - \frac{1}{T^{(2)}} \right )   \delta \underline{U}^{(1)} + \left ( \frac{P^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}}  - \frac{P^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}}\right )\delta \underline{V}^{(1)} \\
& - \left ( \frac{\mu_A^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}} -  \frac{\mu_A^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}} \right )  \delta N_A^{(1)} - \left ( \frac{\mu_B^{(1)}}{T^{(1)}} - \frac{\mu_B^{(2)}}{T^{(2)}} \right ) \delta N_B^{(1)} = 0
\end{aligned}$$

In the most general case, there is no constraint on the value of
$\delta \underline{U}^{(1)}$ or the variation of any other parameter
associated with the individual simple systems. If there are multiple
non-zero parameters that vary, then the condition that
$\delta \underline{S} = 0$ for the isolated, combined system can only be
satisfied for all possible variations in the parameters if each
prefactor on the varying parameter is zero. This means that equilibrium
is satisfied only if:

$$\begin{aligned}
T^{(1)} &= T^{(2)} \label{equal_temp}\\
P^{(1)} &= P^{(2)} \label{equal_pres}\\
\mu_A^{(1)} &= \mu_A^{(2)} \\
\mu_B^{(1)} &= \mu_B^{(2)}
\end{aligned}$$

This assumes that the virtual boundary between the two systems is
diathermal ($\delta \underline{U}^{(1)} \ne 0$), movable
($\delta \underline{V}^{(1)} \ne 0$), and permeable to both components
($\delta N_A^{(1)} \ne 0$ and $\delta N_B^{(1)} \ne 0$).


```{admonition} How would these conditions change if the wall was rigid?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

If the wall is rigid, then
$\delta \underline{V}^{(1)} = \delta \underline{V}^{(2)} = 0$, so
substituting this expression into the above logic indicates that there
would no longer be any condition on the equivalence of the pressure of
the two subsystems, although all other conditions would be met.
</details>
```

Therefore, from this analysis we derive the following general rule: if
two systems are able to exchange the extensive parameter $X$, then at
equilibrium the conjugate intensive parameter $f$ (a first derivative of
the fundamental relation) will be equal between the two systems. These
conditions are equally applicable to phases within a single system or to
the interactions between a system and a reservoir.

## Phase equilibrium in single-component systems

When we will observe a single-phase system?

First, let's choose an ensemble with which to understand this problem.
Consider a single-component system placed in a container with movable
boundaries at constant temperature, like a sample in a beaker, where the
beaker is open to air, allowing the sample to change its volume.
This setup, which is common for many laboratory conditions, exists naturally
in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble, for which the natural variables are
$N$, $P$, and $T$, and our thermodynamic potential is the Gibbs free energy.

In the last lecture, we used {term}`Euler's theorem` to relate the Gibbs free
energy to the chemical potential via the relation:

$$\begin{aligned}
\underline{G} &= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial{N}}\right )_{T, P}  N \\
&= \mu N
\end{aligned}$$

Let's now consider a system which can form two possible phases, denoted
by $(1)$ and $(2)$, with corresponding chemical potentials $\mu^{(1)}$
and $\mu^{(2)}$. Since we have established that at equilibrium the Gibbs
free energy of the system will be minimized, the Euler integrated
expression for the Gibbs free energy provides a straightforward
relationship to determine which phase will be observed. Namely, at
equilibrium in a single-component system at constant $T$ and $P$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\underline{G} &= \mu^{(1)}N^{(1)} + \mu^{(2)}N^{(2)}
\end{aligned}$$

Recognizing that $\underline{G}$ is minimized at equilibrium, and that
the amount of material can freely exchange between the two phases:

```{admonition} Which phase is observed when $\mu^{(1)} < \mu^{(2)}$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Phase (1).
</details>
```
```{admonition} Which phase is observed when $\mu^{(1)} > \mu^{(2)}$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Phase (2).
</details>
```
```{admonition} Which phase is observed when $\mu^{(1)} = \mu^{(2)}$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Both phases.


Note that this is fully consistent with our conditions of
equilibrium described above. 
</details>
```
We thus see that the chemical potential
emerges as the most important quantity for determining phase behavior,
but in principle we cannot control this as easily as the temperature and
pressure. However, recall that the Gibbs-Duhem equation from last
lecture places a constraint on the $n+2$ intensive variables of a
thermodynamic potential such that only $n+1$ are independently variable.
For a single component system, the Gibbs-Duhem equation states:

$$\begin{aligned}
N d\mu &= -\underline{S} dT + \underline{V} dP \\
d\mu &= - SdT + VdP \\
\therefore \mu &= f_1(T,P)
\end{aligned}$$

where $f_1$ is some function that is unknown and system specific. We can
now further write a more general expression for $\mu$ in terms of
experimentally measurable quantities by expressing $S$ and $V$ as
functions of $T$ and $P$ and integrating relative to a reference state:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu = \mu^0 - \int_{T^0}^T [S(T, P)]_{P^0} dT +  \int_{P^0}^P [V(T, P)]_{T} dP
\end{aligned}$$

Note that here we perform the integration by first integrating along an
isobaric path at the reference state pressure, $P^0$, then integrating
along an isothermal path at the temperature of interest, $T$. $\mu^0$ is
the reference state chemical potential. We can now further write out
expressions for $S(T,P)$ and $V(T, P)$ by integrating their exact
differentials:

$$\begin{aligned}
dS &= \left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right )_{P} dT + \left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right )_{T} dP \\
dV &= \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right )_{P} dT + \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right )_{T} dP 
\end{aligned}$$

Fortunately, these partial derivatives can be simplified by recognizing
the definitions of three experimentally measurable materials parameters,
which you have encountered on Problem Set 5:

$$\begin{aligned}
C_P &\equiv T \left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right )_P \quad \text{Heat capacity at constant pressure} \\
\alpha &\equiv \frac{1}{V} \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right )_P \quad \text{Coefficient of thermal expansion} \\
\beta &\equiv -\frac{1}{V} \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right )_T \quad \text{isothermal compressibility} 
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting these expressions into the exact differentials above, and
recognizing the Maxwell relation
$\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right )_{T} = -\left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right )_{P}$,
gives:

$$\begin{aligned}
dS &= \frac{C_P}{T} dT - \alpha V dP \\
dV &= \alpha V dT - \beta V dP 
\end{aligned}$$

All prefactors are now experimentally measurable system-specific
parameters. Integrating each of these expressions from a reference state
(again along an isobaric then isothermal path) and substituting into the
prior expression for the chemical potential yields:

$$\begin{aligned}
S &= S^0 + \int_{T^0}^T \left [\frac{C_P}{T} \right ]_{P^0} dT - \int_{P^0}^P [\alpha V]_{T} dP \\
V &= V^0 + \int_{T^0}^T [\alpha V]_{P^0} dT - \int_{P^0}^P [\beta V]_{T} dP \\
\mu &= \mu^0 - (T-T^0) S^0 + (P-P^0)V^0 \\
& -  \int_{T^0}^T \left [ \int_{T^0}^T \left [\frac{C_P}{T} \right ]_{P^0} dT - \int_{P^0}^P [\alpha V]_{T} dP \right ]_{P^0} dT \nonumber \\
 & + \int_{P^0}^P \left [ \int_{T^0}^T [\alpha V]_{P^0} dT - \int_{P^0}^P [\beta V]_{T} dP \right ]_{T} dP \nonumber
\end{aligned}$$

This expression is obviously quite complicated, with the only obvious
simplification being the elimination of the term
$\int_{P^0}^P [\alpha V]_{T} dP$ because this integral is performed at
constant $P^0$ and thus the upper and lower limits of integration are
the same. The key point, however, is that we have now reduced our
expression for the chemical potential to be only a function of
experimentally measurable parameters - that is, $T$, $P$, $\alpha$,
$\beta$, and $C_P$. We also have introduced parameters related to the
reference state, as indicated by the superscript $0$, but in general we
can choose arbitrary values of $S^0$ and $\mu^0$ and need only know the
physical values of $P^0$, $V^0$, and $T^0$ for a reference state of
interest.

## Phase behavior in single-component systems - PVT Diagrams

The expression for the chemical potential presented above is fully
defined if we know the materials parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, $C_P$,
their temperature and pressure variations, and the pressure, volume, and
temperature of a reference state. However, since $\alpha$ and $\beta$
themselves are defined in terms of the variation of the volume with
respect to temperature and pressure, it is also equally reasonable to
specify the behavior of $C_P$ and the relationship between the pressure,
volume, and temperature.

In other words, **if we know the behavior of a system across PVT we can fully specify
its phase behavior** because PVT behavior defines all parameters that
appear in the expression for the chemical potential. The approach of
specifying PVT behavior is much more prominent in the literature than
specifying $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

![image](figs/fig_22-2-01.png)

We can visualize PVT behavior by plotting constant-temperature isotherms
as a function of volume.

Some observations:
- Repeating these measurements for a series of temperatures would yield the $PVT$ equation of state for the system, which reflects the fundamental equation for the system.
- The behavior in this plot is typical of behavior described by a [cubic equation of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equations_of_state#:~:text=Cubic%20equations%20of%20state%20are,function%20of%20the%20molar%20volume.), such as the well-known van der Waals equation of state.

```{glossary}

dew point
    the volume of the system where liquid starts to precipitate from the vapor phase

vapor pressure
    The pressure at which the vapor phase is in equilibrium with the liquid phase.

saturation pressure
    Another name for the {term}`vapor pressure`.
```

We can interpret this isotherm in terms of phase behavior:

1. If we were to prepare a system that is initially at equilibrium
at a large value of $V$, we would find that it is in a vapor phase.

2. If we then connect the system to a thermal reservoir at a fixed temperature
and a volume reservoir with a controllable pressure, and imagine slowly
increasing the pressure (or equivalently compressing the volume) at an
infinitely slow rate (such that the system is always at equilibrium), we
would find that the system would maintain a vapor state with a volume
specified by the PVT isotherm until a small amount of liquid forms at the {term}`dew point`.

3. As you continue to try to increase the pressure, you would
observe more vapor phase condense to the liquid phase without the
pressure changing until eventually the entire system is liquid, which occurs at the
{term}`vapor pressure` or the {term}`saturation pressure`.

Following from the discussion above, at this
pressure and temperature the chemical potential of a molecule in the
low-molar-volume liquid phase is equal to the chemical potential of a
molecule in the high-molar-volume vapor phase.

```{glossary}
first-order phase transition
    a transition in which a first
    derivative of a thermodynamic potential with respect to some
    thermodynamic parameter is discontinuous
```

The transition from a vapor phase with a well-defined molar volume (or
equivalently, density) to a liquid phase with a smaller molar volume is
an example of a {term}`first-order phase transition`. The volume is the first
deriative of the Gibbs free energy with respect to pressure and the
change in volume is discontinuous between the vapor and liquid states,
satisfying this definition. Phase transitions between different states
of aggregation all fit this criterion; the solid-liquid and solid-vapor
transitions would also involve discontinuities in the volume.

First-order phase transitions are also distinguished by the relase or
adsorption of **latent heat** during the transition. The latent heat is
equal to the molar enthalpy difference, $\Delta H$, between the two
phases; since enthalpy is a state function, the enthalpy of a particular
phase at a specific temperature and pressure is a material property that
will differ between different phases, especially if the phases are
different states of aggregation. Therefore, the transition between
states of aggregation will either require the input or release of energy
to account for these molar enthalpy differences (note that it is an
enthalpy, not an energy, since the volumes of the states will generally
be different as drawn above, requiring $PV$ work to be done as well).

Importantly, the latent heat is enthalpy that is added to or removed
from a system without the system temperature changing, since it accounts
for the transformation of material from one state to another. Thus, if
we were to imagine slowly heating up a solid until it melts to a liquid,
we would observe that the temperature would first increase (at a rate
given by the heat capacity of the material) and then would plateau at
the melting point of the material while the phase transition is
occurring, as all heat being adsorbed would be used for the conversion
of solid to liquid. Once the phase transition is complete, the
temperature would continue to rise at a different rate given the
different heat capacity of the liquid phase.

During this process, we would have to change the rate of heat flow to
maintain a constant change of temperature, which would allow us to
determine the magnitude of the latent heat and heat capacities of both
phases - this observation is the operating principle behind differential
scanning calorimetry.
