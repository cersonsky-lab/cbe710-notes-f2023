## Question 1: Ferromagnetic phase transition

Ferromagnetic materials undergo an order-disorder transition as a
function of temperature. The 2D Ising model is able to reproduce this
transition. Recall that the [Ising model](../lecture_files/Lecture8A) consists of $N$ distinguishable
spins on a lattice. Each spin has one of two discrete values:
$s_i = \pm 1$. The magnetization, $M$, is the sum of all spins,
$M = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mu s_i$. Spins can interact with an external
magnetic field, $H$, and other nearest-neighbor spins. For this problem
we will assume $H=0$. The energy with which spin $i$ interacts with its
neighbors is:

```{math}
\epsilon_i =  - J \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j
```

$J$ is the coupling parameter (in the same units as energy) that determines the
interaction energy between each *pair* of nearest-neighbor spins. The
sum $\sum_j^\prime$ indicates a sum over all $n$ nearest-neighbor spins
of $i$ on the lattice. The *total* energy of the system is:

$$E_\nu = - \frac{J}{2} \sum_{i}^N \sum_j^\prime s_i s_j$$

The factor of $1/2$ accounts for the double-counting of interactions
between pairs of spins when summing over the entire system. In class, we
used a mean-field approximation to show that

$$T_C = \frac{nJ}{k_B}$$

$T_C$ is the temperature at which the system transitions from non-zero
magnetization to zero magnetization. However, the mean-field
approximation introduces significant errors. In this problem, we will
show that Monte Carlo simulations can identify a more accurate
expression for $T_C$.


```{admonition} **(a)**

Develop a simulation representation of an Ising model in which
$N = 400$ spins are placed on a 2D, periodic, square lattice, such that
each lattice point has $n=4$ nearest-neighbors. Plot the absolute value
of the ensemble-average magnetization per spin,
$| \langle M \rangle / N |$, and the heat capacity, $C_V$, as a function
of temperature for a coupling parameter $J = 1.0$.

Choose a temperature range of $T = 0.1$ $J/k_B$ to $T = 6.0$ $J/k_B$ in increments of $0.1$
$J/k_B$. The coupling parameter is expressed in dimensionless units;
accordingly, $J$ is the unit of energy and $J/k_B$ is the unit of
temperature.

I suggest running for at least 1,000,000 trials, saving the
magnetization every 500 steps, and averaging the results from multiple
independent simulations. Explain any other choices you make for
simulation parameters. Consider which pairwise interactions actually
contribute during evaluation of the MC acceptance condition; it is not
necessary to compute the energy of the entire lattice.

A [first-order phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition#Ehrenfest_classification)
is characterized by a discontinuity in a first derivative of the free energy with respect to
the temperature when the system undergoes a phase transition, while a
[second-order phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition#Ehrenfest_classification) is characterized by the divergence of
a second derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature when
the system undergoes a phase transition. Based on your results in part
**a**, is the ferromagnetic order-disorder transition classified as a
first or second order phase transition? Explain your rationale.

## Question 2: Molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid

Consider a set of particles that interact via a {term}`Lennard-Jones potential`.
This system, referred to as a *Lennard-Jones fluid*, captures the
behavior of simple solvents. Develop a simulation model for a
Lennard-Jones fluid in which $N = 125$ particles are placed in a 3D,
periodic, cubic simulation box. Assume particles only interact via a
Lennard-Jones potential with characteristic energy $\epsilon$ and length
$\sigma$ which set the energy and length scales of the simulations,
respectively.

<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

-   Use a dimensionless timestep of $\Delta t = 0.001$.

-   Assume the mass of each particle is $m=1.0$.

-   Set the Boltzmann constant to $k_B = 1.0$.

-   Sample and save system properties every 100 timesteps.

-   For your final simulations, run for at least 100,000 timesteps (this
    should take $< 15$ mins).

- Reduce the number of particles and
simulation timesteps while you are testing code.
- Save your trajectories (positions and velocities), to prevent running the
code an excessive number of times.
