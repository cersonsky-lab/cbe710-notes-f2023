# Problem Set 5 (Due Wednesday, November 29, 2023)

## Question 1: Actual gas expansion

$N$ moles of an ideal gas at a temperature $T_1$ are adiabatically
expanded from a pressure $P_1$ to a pressure $P_2$. The amount of work
produced by a reversible adiabatic expansion between these two pressures
is calculated to be $\delta \underline{W}_\textrm{rev}$. The amount of
work extracted when the process is actually performed is instead
measured as $\delta\underline{W}_\textrm{actual}$, although the process
is still adiabatic. The heat capacities of the gas at constant volume
and constant pressure are $C^0_V = 5R/2$ and $C^0_P = 7R/2$,
respectively, and are not found to depend on temperature.

```{admonition} **(a)**
What is the final temperature, $T_2$, of the gas after the
expansion (i.e., the temperature when the process is actually
performed)?
```

```{admonition} **(b)**
Show that the entropy change during this process is:

$\Delta \underline{S} = \frac{7NR}{2} \ln \frac{2\delta W_\textrm{actual} + 5NRT_1}{2\delta W_\textrm{rev}+ 5NRT_1}$

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

Consider our process as two separate processes, one the reversible, adiabatic process from $T_1, P_1$ to
$T_{rev}, P_2$, and the second the irreversible process from $T_{rev}, P_2$ to $T_2, P_2$.

## Question 2: Equations of state

Consider a system with the fundamental relation:

$$U(S,V) = \left ( \frac{\theta}{R} \right ) S^2 - \left ( \frac{R\theta}{V_0^2} \right ) V^2$$

$\theta, R$ and $V_0$ are positive constants.

```{admonition} **(a)**
Find the three equations of state for $T$, $P$, and $\mu$ for
this system, and further show that $\mu = -U$.
```

```{admonition} **(b)**
Demonstrate that only two of the intensive parameters are
independently variable.
```

## Question 3: High pressure gas

A gas at high pressure flows through a duct. A thermometer held within
the duct measures the temperature of the gas at a high temperature
$T_H$. A small amount of gas is then released from the duct through a
valve to the outside atmosphere, which has a pressure $P_\textrm{out}$.
The process by which this gas is released occurs at **constant
enthalpy** (where $\underline{H}=\underline{U}+P\underline{V}$) as
indicated in the diagram below.

Note that the enthalpy is a state function. The temperature of the gas
leaving the valve is measured at a colder temperature $T_C$. The gas
obeys the equation of state:

$$\frac{PV}{RT} = 1 + \left ( b- \frac{a}{T}\right ) \frac{P}{RT}$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants that do not depend on temperature or
pressure. The molar heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_P$, is
defined as:

$$C_P =  T \left ( \frac{\partial {S}}{\partial T} \right )_P$$

The heat capacity $C_P^\textrm{out}$ is measured at the pressure
$P_\textrm{out}$ and does not depend on temperature.

```{admonition} Question
Shown that the
pressure of the gas in the duct, $P_\textrm{in}$, equals

$P_\text{in} = P_{\textrm{out}} - \frac{C_P^{P_{\textrm{out}}}(T_h - T_C)}{b- \frac{2a}{T_H} }$

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

- Define the state path of enthalpy in terms of independent isothermal and isobaric paths.
- Leverage {term}`Maxwell relation`s.

## Question 4: Calculus of thermodynamics

It is often convenient to relate derivatives that are difficult to
calculate experimentally to measurable materials parameters. Prove the
following relationships by appropriately manipulating the relevant
derivatives. The following materials parameters are defined:

-   The thermal expansion coefficient,
    $\alpha =\frac{1}{V} \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right )_P$

-   The isothermal compressibility,
    $\beta =-\frac{1}{V} \left ( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right )_T$

-   The heat capacity at constant volume,
    $C_V = T\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right )_V$

-   The heat capacity at constant pressure,
    $C_P = T\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right )_P$

```{admonition} **(a)**
$\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right )_{V} = \frac{C_V}{T} \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$.
```

```{admonition} **(b)**
$\left ( \frac{\partial T}{\partial P} \right )_S = \frac{T\alpha V}{C_P}$
```

```{admonition} **(c)**
$\left ( \frac{\partial C_V}{\partial V} \right )_T = T\left ( \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial T^2} \right )_V$
```
