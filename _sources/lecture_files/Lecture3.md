## Goals for today's lecture
- Derive a physical observable in the context of the microcanonical ensemble.
- Understand and apply Stirling's approximation from last lecture.


## Problem Statement

In the last lecture, we introduced the concept of the microcanonical
ensemble, which we defined as the set of all possible microstates
associated with a macrostate in which the number of particles ($N$), the
volume ($V$), and the energy ($E$) are constant. We then defined several
postulates of statistical mechanics, which we summarize as:

-   $Y_\textrm{obs} = \langle Y \rangle$: the ergodic hypothesis, where
    $\langle Y \rangle = \sum_i^\textrm{states} p_i Y_i$

-   $p_i = \frac{1}{\Omega(N,V,E)}$: the principle of equal a priori
    probabilities, where $\Omega(N,V,E)$ is the degeneracy (or number of
    states) of the microcanonical ensemble

-   $S = k_B \ln \Omega(N,V,E)$: the definition of the Boltzmann
    entropy.

We will now use an example to illustrate how the microcanonical ensemble
can provide information about the thermodynamic properties of a system.


Consider a polymer chain that adsorbs to an attractive surface.

![image](figs/fig_3_1-01.png)

The chain is composed of $N$ monomers that do not interact with each other.
The surface is attractive such that a single monomer adsorbs favorably
with an energy $-\epsilon$. If we assume the energy of the free monomers
is 0 and there are no monomer-monomer interactions, then the total
energy of the system for $n$ adsorbed monomers is:

$$E = \sum_i^N \epsilon_i = -n \epsilon$$


The question we will ask is - how does the energy of the system (or,
equivalently, the number of adsorbed monomers) depend on the
temperature?


To start -- what relationships do we know for our system?

-   $E = -n \epsilon$ from the microscopic description of the system
    given above

-   $S = k_B \ln \Omega (E)$ from the definition of the entropy of the
    microcanonical ensemble using the shorthand version of
    $\Omega(N,V,E)$

-   $T = \left ( \frac{\partial E}{\partial S} \right )_V$ from
    thermodynamics


Given these relationships, we can use the equations of the
microcanonical ensemble to relate the degeneracy to the entropy and then
identify a relationship between the energy and temperature from
thermodynamics. Thus, we will describe our system as having a constant
energy - that is, we assume that $n$ and $E$ are fixed and then will
derive a temperature dependence based on this assumption. There may be
another ensemble that is more appropriate - for example, we may assume
the temperature is constant, instead, and choose a different ensemble
(e.g. the canonical ensemble) to solve for the temperature dependence.
If we are consistent in our assumptions and mathematical framework, then
any ensemble is fine (as long as the fixed thermodynamic variables in
the ensemble do not violate some feature of the system) and we will
return to this problem with alternative ensembles in future lectures.

We need to start by computing an expression for the degeneracy.
Recalling previous sections, we know that $\Omega(E)$ is defined as the
number of microstates that have the same energy $E = - n\epsilon$. Since
the number of total monomers, $N$, is greater than the number of
adsorbed monomers, $n$, there are many possible ways to choose the the
set of $n$ adsorbed monomers from the total set of $N$ monomers, but any
set of $n$ that we select will have the same energy. Therefore, the
degeneracy of this system is equal to the number of unique ways to
select $n$ monomers that adsorb to the surface out of the possible set
of $N$ - or in other words, the number of unique ways to split the $N$
monomers into two groups (adsorbed and free). Computing this quantity
will motivate a mathematical aside.

## Relevant Mathematics
### Combinatorics

Imagine that you have $N$ objects. In general, objects can either be

```{glossary}
distinguishable
    objects that can be told apart, such as playing cards, or

indistinguishable
    objects that cannot be told apart, such as marbles
```
A common question we will face is how many
ways we can uniquely divide $N$ distinguishable objects into groups. We
can calculate this using playing cards as an example. First, we can
count the number of unique ways to shuffle a deck of $N$ distinguishable
playing cards. We can imagine placing the first card on the top of the
deck; there are $N$ possible choices for the first card. Next, we can
imagine placing the next card on the top of the deck. Since we have
removed 1 card, there are now $N-1$ choices remaining, so there are
$N(N-1)$ unique choices for placing the first two cards, and so on. This
leads to:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{# of arrangements} &= N(N-1)(N-2) \dots (2)(1) \nonumber \\
&= N!
\end{aligned}$$

If the playing cards were instead indistinguishable, then there would
instead be only unique 1 arrangement of playing cards (since switching
the order of any two cards would make the order look exactly the same).
Now, we consider the question how many ways there
are to divide $N$ distinguishable playing cards into two groups, one
containing $n_1$ cards and the second containing $N-n_1$ cards.
Following the same reasoning as above, for the first group we have $N$
options for the first card, $N-1$ for the second, and so on, until for
the last selection we have $N-n_1+1$ choices. The total number of
arrangements for group 1 is thus:

$$\begin{aligned}
N(N-1)(N-2)\dots(N-n_1+1) &= \frac{N(N-1)(N-2)\dots(2)(1)}{(N-n_1)(N-n_1-1)\dots(2)(1)} \nonumber \\ 
&= \frac{N!}{(N-n_1)!}
\end{aligned}$$

The second group has $N-n_1!$ choices for placing the
remaining $N-n_1$ cards, so that in total there are
$\left [ N!/(N-n_1)!\right ] \times (N-n_1)! = N!$ arrangements of the
two groups.

However, the question asked for how many ways there are to
**divide** them into two groups; the arrangement of cards within each
group does not matter, as placing the same $n_1$ cards in the group in
any order is still the same division. There are $n_1!$ ways to arrange
the $n_1$ cards in the first group and $(N-n_1)!$ ways to arrange the
cards in the second group, so in total we have overcounted by
$n_1!(N-n_1)!$ since every division into a group of $n_1$ and $N-N_1$
was counted an extra $n_1!(N-n_1)!$ times associated with different
orders of the cards. Thus, the total number of unique ways of dividing
the cards into two groups if the order within each group doesn't matter
is:

$$\text{# of divisions} = \frac{N!}{n_1!(N-n_1)!}$$

This expression appears in the binomial expansion and is referred to as
the [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient), and can be expanded to any number of groups
following similar reasoning.

### [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)

We have just seen an example of a calculation that uses factorials,
which can become difficult to treat algebraically. Fortunately, there is
an approximation that simplifies the use of factorials. Because $N!$ is
a product, it is easier to deal with $\ln N!$ which is a sum. We can
write:

$$\ln N! = \sum_{m=1}^N \ln m$$

![image](figs/fig_3_2-01.gif)

The value of this sum is equal to the total area of a series of
rectangles, each with height $\ln m$ and width $dm = 1$. That is, we can
equate the sum to the integral of $\ln m$ using rectangular integration.

As $N$ increases, the difference between successive terms in the sum
will become very small - if $N \gg 1$, the difference in the terms
becomes:

$$\begin{aligned}
\ln (m+1) - \ln m = \ln \frac{m+1}{m} \approx \ln 1 \approx 0 \quad \text{for $m\gg1$}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, for $N\gg1$ we can replace the sum over discrete values of
$m$ with an integral over continuous values of $m$ - effectively
allowing the width of each rectangle ($dm$) to shrink to an
infinitesimal value. The error between the approximation using an
integral and the exact sum over integer values of $m$ is very small once
$N$ is large. The resulting approximation allows us to write:

```{math}
:label: stirling

\ln N! &= \sum_{m=1}^N \ln m \nonumber \\
&\approx \int_1^N \ln m dm  \quad \text{if $N \gg 1$} \nonumber\\
&= \boxed{N \ln N - N} 
```

Equation {eq}`stirling` is **Stirling's approximation**, and differs by
less than 1% from $\ln N!$ if $N > 50$. We will make frequent use of
Stirling's approximation, and moreover we will often approximate
summations as integrals, throughout the course. We will return to
solving the example using Stirling's approximation and combinatorics in
the next lecture.


## Back to the example

Reminder, our overarching question is: how does the energy of the system
(or, equivalently, the number of adsorbed monomers) depend on the temperature?

Having defined methods for splitting objects into two groups, we can now
count how many ways there are to separate $N$ monomers into a group of
$n$ that are adsorbed to a surface and $N-n$ that are not which defines
the degeneracy of a microcanonical ensemble with
$\langle E \rangle = n\epsilon$.

We thus write an expression for
$\Omega(E)$ and the entropy based on the combinatorics expression above:


```{admonition} $S =  k_B \ln \left ( \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \right )$
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Show derivation]</summary>


  $$
  \Omega(E) &= \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}\\
  S         &= k_B \ln \Omega(E) \\
            &= k_B \ln \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \\
  $$

```



```{admonition} $S =  -k_B N \left[\alpha \ln \alpha  + (1-\alpha)\ln(1-\alpha)\right]$, where $\alpha \equiv n/N$
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Show derivation]</summary>

  First, some algebra,
  
  $$
  S =  k_B \left[\ln(N!) - \ln(n!) - \ln[(N-n)!]\right]
  $$

  Using Stirling's approximation,

  $$
  S &=  k_B \left[N\ln N - N - n\ln n + n -(N-n)\ln(N-n) + (N-n)\right]\\
    &=  k_B \left[N\ln N  - n\ln n -(N-n)\ln(N-n)\right]\\
  $$

  Replacing all $n$ with $N \alpha$

  $$
    &=  k_B \left[N\ln N  - N\alpha \ln (N\alpha) -(N-N\alpha)\ln(N-N\alpha)\right]\\
    &=  k_B N \left[\ln N  - \alpha \ln (N\alpha) -(1-\alpha)\ln(N(1-\alpha))\right]\\
    &=  - k_B N \left[\alpha \ln \alpha  + (1-\alpha)\ln(1-\alpha)\right]\\
  $$

</details>
```

With this equation relating the entropy and our number of adsorbed monomers,
and our earlier equation relating the energy to the number of adsorbed monomers,
we can determine the temperature dependence of the latter by using


$$
\left ( \frac{\partial E}{\partial S} \right )_V = T
$$

Given that the relationship $\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}$ is more
well-defined, we flip our equation:

$$
\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial E} \right )_V = \frac{1}{T}
$$

```{admonition} $n = \frac{N}{ 1 +  e^{-\epsilon / k_BT}}$
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Show derivation]</summary>


   $$
    \left ( -\frac{\partial S}{\partial (n\epsilon)} \right )_V &= \frac{1}{T} \\
    -\frac{1}{\epsilon}\left (\frac{\partial S}{\partial \alpha}\right)_V\left (\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial n} \right )_V &= \frac{1}{T} \\
   $$

   where

   $$
   \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial \alpha}\right)_V = k_B N \left[\ln(1-\alpha) - \ln\alpha\right]\\
   \left(\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial n}\right)_V = \frac{1}{N}
   $$

   such that
   
  $$
    \frac{-k_B}{\epsilon}\left[ (\ln(1-\alpha) - \ln\alpha) \right] &= \frac{1}{T} \\
    \ln(\frac{1}{\alpha}-1) &= \frac{-\epsilon}{k_B T} \\
    \frac{1}{\alpha} &= 1 + e^{-\epsilon / k_BT} \\
    \frac{N}{n} &= 1 + e^{-\epsilon / k_BT} \\
   $$

   ```{math}
   :label: twostatemicrofinal
    n = \frac{N}{1 + e^{-\epsilon / k_BT}} 
   ```

</details>


Equation {eq}`twostatemicrofinal` relates the number of adsorbed monomers
to microscopic features (i.e. the adsorption energy per monomer and
total number of monomers) as a function of the system temperature.

As $T$ goes to 0, we expect the system to be in an energy-minimizing
configuration with all monomers bound - indeed, as $T\rightarrow 0$,
$n\rightarrow N$, indicating that all monomers adsorb.

In the opposite
extreme, as $T \rightarrow \infty$, $n\rightarrow N/2$, indicating that
at infinite temperature exactly half of the monomers bind to the
surface. This makes conceptual sense - if we have infinite thermal
energy, the energy for adsorption is negligible so adsorbing or not
adsorbing is equally likely for each monomer (we will revisit this
result in future lectures).

This example illustrates the basic principles of the statistical
mechanics approach:

- we begin by identifying a set of constant
macroscopic thermodynamic variables for the system ($NVE$),
- choose an appropriate statistical ensemble (microcanonical) corresponding to these
variables,
- calculate the value for a thermodynamic variable (entropy) from ensemble properties based on our microscopic picture of the system,
- then use thermodynamic relations to get additional information about the
system (temperature).

```{admonition} Why does our final result seem to contradict our assumption that energy is constant?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>
Recall that the problem statement itself (i.e. the microscopic
description of the system) does not specific a constant energy - we
**choose** to describe our system in such a way that the energy is held
constant, then apply the equations of the microcanonical ensemble
(consistent with our choice) to derive the temperature dependence. We
also could have derived the same result by assuming that the system is
held at constant temperature and that the energy is allowed to vary, and
achieve the same result (we will do this next lecture). We will find
several variations of this basic approach, and will illustrate that the
correct choice of thermodynamic variables, even for the same system, can
dramatically simplify problem solutions.
