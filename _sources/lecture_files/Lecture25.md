## Introduction to mixtures: partial molar properties

So far, we have only calculated the fugacity of a single-component
system at phase equilibrium. Now, we will extend our framework to
consider mixtures. First, let's consider some simple definitions when
dealing with mixtures. We define $x_i$ as the mole fraction of component
$i$, such that:

$$\begin{aligned}
x_i &\equiv \frac{N_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n N_i} \\
&= \frac{N_i}{N} \\
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i &= 1
\end{aligned}$$

Each of the $N_i$ is given in moles, and $N$ is the total number of
moles in the mixture. Note that by convention $x_i$ refers to mole
fractions in a liquid or solid phase and $y_i$ refers to mole fractions
in a vapor phase. Using $x_i$ (or $y_i$) in place of $N_i$ allows us to
write an intensive form of some potential $B$; for example, the
intensive Gibbs free energy of a multicomponent mixture is then:

$$\begin{aligned}
G(T,P,x_1, x_2, \dots x_n)
\end{aligned}$$

We could also write two equivalent expressions for the extensive value
of the Gibbs free energy:

$$\begin{aligned}
\underline{G}(T,P, N_1, N_2,\dots N_n) = \underline{G}(T, P, x_1, x_2, \dots x_{n-1}, N)
\end{aligned}$$

We can determine $x_n$ from the other mole fractions by the constraint
above. Now, let us consider what happens to system properties during the
process of mixing relative to the properties of the independent pure
components of that mixture. In other words, the process we consider is
taking separate single-component systems and mixing their constituents
into a single-phase mixture with a given composition.

```{admonition} For a mixture, why can't we just compute the weighted average of the properties of the components? E.g. why, for volume, does $V\ne x_1 V_1 + x_2 V_2$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

The difference in volume will emerge from the interactions between the
two components, which will likely differ in their attraction or
repulsion from interactions of a given component with other molecules of
the same type.
</details>
```

To account for interactions between components, we can
instead define the increment in the value of some parameter $B$ for the
entire system upon addition of a single component, $i$, we define the

```{glossary}

partial molar property

    of component $i$, which is the
    increment in the value of some parameter $B$ for the entire system upon
    addition of a single component, $i$:

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \overline{B}_i &\equiv \left(\frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial N_i}\right)_{T,P,N_j \ne N_i}
    \end{aligned}$$

```

Here, the overline indicates a partial molar property of component $i$
and the partial derivative indicates the change in the (extensive) value
of $\underline{B}$ for the mixture upon increment of component $i$, with
the amount of each other component $j$ held fixed. By definition,
partial molar properties are defined with the temperature and pressure
also held constant, as these are the two independent variables commonly
associated with phase behavior.

```{admonition} Why are all partial molar properties intensive?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Because the derivative is always performed with respect to the number
of moles of a single component.
</details>
```

We can define a simple expression for the extensive value of
$\underline{B}$ in terms of partial molar properties by again using
{term}`Euler's theorem`. If we write the exact differential for $\underline{B}$
as a function of the $n$ components, $T$, and $P$, we obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
d\underline{B}(T,P, N_1, N_2, \dots, N_n) &= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial T}\right )_{P, N_j} dT + \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial P}\right )_{T, N_j} dP + \sum_i^n \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial N_i}\right )_{T,P, N_j \ne N_i} dN_i \\
&= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial T}\right )_{P, N_j} dT + \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial P}\right )_{T, N_j} dP + \sum_i^n \overline{B}_i dN_i
\end{aligned}$$

By Euler's theorem, we obtain expressions for the first-order derivative
of $\underline{B}$ with respect to each extensive variable (the set of
$N_i$) multiplied by the corresponding extensive variable:

$$\begin{aligned}
\underline{B} &=  \sum_i^n \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{B}}{\partial N_i}\right )_{T,P, N_j \ne N_i} N_i \\
&= \sum_i^n \overline{B}_i N_i
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, we obtain a straightforward expression for the extensive
value of $\underline{B}$ for a mixture in terms of partial molar
properties of each component. Since $\underline{B} = NB$, where
$N = \sum_i^n N_i$ is the total amount of material, we can also then
obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
B &= \frac{\underline{B}}{N} \\
&= \frac{\sum_i^n \overline{B}_i N_i}{N} \\
&= \sum_i^n \overline{B}_i x_i
\end{aligned}$$

```{admonition} How is the chemical potential related to the partial molar Gibbs free energy?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

They are equal!

If we let $\underline{B} \equiv \underline{G}$, then the partial molar Gibbs
free energy is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
\overline{G}_i &= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial N_i}\right )_{T,P, N_j \ne N_i} 
\end{aligned}$$

By comparison with the exact differential of the Gibbs free energy
(defined in terms of its natural variables, such that it is a [Legendre
transform](Lecture20) of the fundamental relation) we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
d\underline{G} &= -\underline{S} dT + \underline{V} dP + \sum_i^n \mu_i dN_i \\
%&= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial T}\right )_{P, N_j} dT + \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial P}\right )_{T, N_j} dP + \sum_i^n \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial N_i}\right )_{T,P, N_{j, [i]}} dN_i \\
\therefore \mu_i &= \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{G}}{\partial N_i}\right )_{T,P, N_j \ne N_i} = \overline{G}_i \\
G &= \sum_i^n x_i \mu_i
\end{aligned}$$

We thus find that the partial molar Gibbs free energy of component $i$
is identical to the chemical potential of component $i$, and we regain
an expression for the Gibbs free energy of the mixture that is similar
to the expression for the Gibbs free energy of a single-component system
that we obtained from Euler's theorem.
</details>
```

## Property changes upon mixing

We can now write the change in a given property upon mixing by
considering the value of this property $B$ of each of the $n$ pure components and then
the value of $B$ for the mixture; since $B$ is a state function, the
pathway by which mixing occurs is irrelevant. We can thus write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta B_\textrm{mix} &= B - \sum_i^n x_i B_i \\
&= \sum_i^n x_i (\overline{B}_i - B_i)
\end{aligned}$$

We call $\Delta B_\textrm{mix}$ the change in the value of a property of
a mixture relative to pure components the entropy of mixing, energy of
mixing, free energy of mixing, etc. depending on $B$. In this notation,
$B$ refers to the (intensive) value of $B$ for the entire mixture while
$\sum_i^n x_i B_i$ is the value of $B$ for each individual component
weighted by the mole fraction of that component. Of particular interest
is the Gibbs free energy of mixing; since the Gibbs free energy is
minimized at equilibrium, mixing can only occur at equilibribum if
$\Delta G_\textrm{mix} < 0$ (although we will discuss that there is a
subtlety here that may not be obvious). We can write for the Gibbs free
energy of mixing:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_\textrm{mix} &= \sum_i^n x_i (\overline{G}_i - G_i)
\end{aligned}$$

We can break this free energy change into two separate components by
recalling the definition of the Gibbs free energy from {term}`Euler's theorem`:

$$\begin{aligned}
G &= U + PV - TS \\
&= H - TS \\
\therefore \Delta G_\textrm{mix} &= \Delta H_\textrm{mix} - T \Delta S_\textrm{mix}
\end{aligned}$$

Analysis of the enthalpy and entropy of mixing is often performed
separately to determine under which conditions mixing occurs.

```{admonition} What do you think the sign of the enthalpy of mixing will be for systems where self-interactions are stronger than cross-interactions?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

For most systems, the
enthalpy of mixing is positive, since intermolecular interactions
between a species with itself tend to be more attractive than
cross-interactions with other species. Thus, the enthalpy of mixing
tends to drive phase separation; an extreme example would be the
separation of two liquid phases, such as oil and water. Enthalpy changes
in gas mixtures are likely to be quite small due to the low probability
of interactions between gas molecules.
</details>
```

```{admonition} What do you think the sign of the entropy of mixing will be for systems?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Conversely, the entropy of mixing
tends to be positive, leading to a negative contribution to the Gibbs
free energy of mixing. The gain in entropy of mixing was studied in the
statistical mechanics unit and can be attributed to the additional
configurations accessible upon mixing.
</details>
```

We note that both the
entropy and enthalpy of mixing will be highly dependent on the
composition of the mixture, as will be discussed for idealized examples
below.

We can make some comments on phase-separation processes briefly here,
and will discuss these again in the next lecture. If we imagine fixing
an overall system composition at some value $z_i$, we can determine if
the overall free energy change of mixing is positive or negative for a
single phase at that fixed composition. If it is negative, then the two
pure components, initially separated, might mix to form a single phase
at that composition because doing so will lower the Gibbs free energy of
the system.

However, even if the free energy change is positive at the
composition $z_i$, there may be other compositions for which the free
energy change is negative (similarly, even if the free energy change is
negative, there might be other compositions for which the free energy is
more negative). Therefore, the system may be able to mix into two phases
of different compositions that are not pure phases to minimize the total
free energy change. This insight tells us that a single value of
$\Delta G_\textrm{mix}$ is insufficient to understand phase behavior,
and we require knowledge of $\Delta G_\textrm{mix}$ for a full range of
compositions. Analysis of these phase separation processes will be
discussed in the next lecture.

## Fugacity of a component in a mixture

In the last lecture, we defined a quantity, the {term}`fugacity`, which has
units of pressure and is related to the deviation of the chemical
potential of a real system from the chemical potential of an ideal
system (*i.e.*, the isothermal Gibbs departure function). We found that
the conditions of phase equilibrium could be restated as the equivalence
of fugacities between phases in a single-component system. We then
introduced mixtures, and specifically the idea of partial molar
properties as measuring the change in the property of a mixture upon
increment of only one component. We can now return to conditions of
phase equilibrium for mixtures by defining the fugacity of a component
in a mixture. Recall that we defined the fugacity of a single-component
system as:

$$\begin{aligned}
G_i - G_i^0 &= RT \ln \frac{f_i}{P} \\
d G_i &= d\mu_i = RT d \ln f_i
\end{aligned}$$

We can now define a related quantity, the {term}`fugacity of a component in a
mixture`, in terms of the isothermal departure of the partial molar
Gibbs free energy, or:

```{glossary}
fugacity of a component in a mixture

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \overline{G}_i - \overline{G}_i^0 &= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{y_i P} \\
    d \overline{G}_i &= d\mu_i = RT d\ln \hat{f}_i
    \end{aligned}$$
```

Here, we recognize that we can again relate the partial molar Gibbs free
energy to the chemical potential.

- $\overline{G}_i^0$ refers to the partial molar Gibbs free energy for component $i$ in a mixture of ideal gases with the same composition as the mixture of interest.
- $\hat{f}_i$ is the fugacity of a component in a mixture
- $f_i$ to define the fugacity of the same component in a single-component system containing pure component $i$
- $y_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the mixture, such that $y_i P = P_i$ or the partial pressure of component $i$ (we the symbol $y_i$ to refer to mole fractions for vapor-phase mixtures whereas $x_i$ refers to mole fractions for liquid or solid-phase mixtures).

```{admonition} What is the fugacity of component $i$ in a mixture of ideal gases equal to?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Since the fugacity of a
pure ideal gas is defined as equal to the pressure, the fugacity of
component $i$ in a mixture of ideal gases is defined as equal to the
partial pressure.
</details>
```

As in a single-component case, we can also define the fugacity
coefficient of component $i$ in a mixture as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{\phi}_i \equiv \frac{\hat{f}_i}{y_i P}
\end{aligned}$$

We use $y_i$ to refer to the mole fraction of the component in the
mixture assuming a vapor phase, but we could write the same definitions
using $x_i$ were the mixture in the liquid phase. Using this definition
of the fugacity of component $i$, we can again find conditions of
equilibrium (using vapor-liquid equilibrium as an example) by
integrating the expression for the chemical potential between the two
phases; along any path both the volume and composition of the system
would change, but the path itself does not matter since the chemical
potential is a state function. We would thus obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
d\mu_i &= RT d\ln \hat{f}_i \\
\mu_i^{\textrm{liq}} - \mu_i^{\textrm{vap}} &= RT\ln \left ( \frac{\hat{f}_i^{\textrm{liq}}}{\hat{f}_i^{\textrm{vap}}}\right ) = 0 \\
\therefore \hat{f}_i^{\textrm{liq}} &= \hat{f}_i^{\textrm{vap}} \\
\therefore  x_i\hat{\phi}_i^\textrm{liq}P &= y_i\hat{\phi}_i^\textrm{vap}P
\end{aligned}$$

At equilibrium the pressure is the same for both phases, but we include
$P$ on each side of this equation to emphasize the relationship between
the fugacity coefficient of component $i$ and the corresponding
fugacity. We use $x_i$ and $y_i$ to refer to the mole fraction of $i$ in
the correct phase.

```{admonition} Why is it necessary to differentiate $x_i$ and $y_i$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

In general, the composition of the vapor phase and liquid phase will be different at
phase equilibrium - that is, $y_i \ne x_i$. We do not require identical
compositions at equilibrium, only identical fugacitities for the
corresponding components.
</details>
```

If we imagine integrating the chemical potential along an isothermal,
isobaric path in which a single-component system containing pure $i$ is
transformed to a mixture in which the composition of component $i$ is
given by $y_i$, we would obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
d\mu_i^{\textrm{pure}} &= dG_i = RT d\ln f_i \\
d\mu_i^{\textrm{mixed}} &= d\overline{G}_i = RT d\ln \hat{f}_i \\
\mu_i^\textrm{mixed} - \mu_i^{\textrm{pure}} &= \overline{G}_i - G_i \\
&= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{f_i} \\
\therefore \overline{G}_i - G_i &= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{f_i}
\end{aligned}$$

The difference between the free energy change associated with adding
component $i$ to either a mixture or a pure system is related to the
ratio of fugacities of that component in the mixture of a pure state.
We'll use this relationship again shortly.

Finally, by comparing this expression to the expression for the Gibbs
free energy of mixing, we also then recognize:

$$\begin{aligned}
\overline{G}_i - G_i &= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{f_i} \\
\therefore \Delta G_\textrm{mix} &= RT \sum_i^n x_i \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{f_i}
\end{aligned}$$

In principle, then, we can calculate the Gibbs free energy of mixing if
we know compressibility factors for the pure components and the mixture,
enabling fugacity calculations like those discussed in the last lecture.
Calculating the fugacity of a component in a mixture is similar to the
calculating the fugacity of a pure component, except that the departure
function of a partial molar Gibbs free energy is needed, leading to
slightly different calculations. We will not discuss this further but
the topic is covered in Ch. 9.7 of {cite:ts}`tester_thermodynamics_1997`.

## Ideal-gas mixtures and ideal solutions

Having defined general expressions for the properties of a mixture, we
will now discuss the behavior of idealized mixtures with properties that
are easily defined in terms of the properties of their pure
constituents. Thus we define two approximations:

```{glossary}
ideal-gas mixture
    a mixture of gases in the limit that the entire mixture acts as an ideal gas.
    That is, there are no interactions between molecules.

ideal solution
    a mixture of two or more components in which it is assumed that the intermolecular interactions
    between component $i$ and $j$ are the same as the intermolecular
    interactions between any component $i$ with itself. Another way of
    putting this is that adding a small amount of component $i$ to the
    mixture elicits the same change in the system enthalpy as adding a small
    amount of component $i$ to a pure system.
```

By these definitions, then, we have that the partial molar enthalpy of an ideal-gas mixture (IG)
is equal to that of the pure ideal gas phase

$$\overline{H}_i^\textrm{IG} = H_i^{\textrm{IG}}$$

and thus

$$\Delta H_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IG} = \sum_i y_i(\overline{H}_i^\textrm{IG} - H_i^{\textrm{IG}}) = 0 $$

and that the partial molar enthalpy of mixture of the ideal solution (IS) is equal to that
of the pure phase as well

$$\begin{aligned}
\overline{H}_i^\textrm{IS} &= H_i \\
\Delta H_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IS} &= \sum_i x_i(\overline{H}_i^\textrm{IS} - H_i) = 0
\end{aligned}$$

We write the mole fraction as $x_i$ for the ideal solution assuming a
liquid phase, but a vapor phase can also be an ideal solution in which
case $y_i$ would be appropriate. We can further generalize these same
relations to other extensive variables that depend on system
interactions, including the internal energy and volume of mixing;
however, the entropy of mixing requires special treatment as it depends
on system configurations, as we will return to:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta U_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IG} &= \Delta U_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IS} =0\\
\Delta V_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IG} &= \Delta V_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IS} =0
\end{aligned}$$

The ideal solution approximation is reasonable for liquid-phase mixtures
in which the constituent molecules have very similar chemical
properties, such as mixtures of liquid alkanes with slightly varying
chain lengths. It is also appropriate for most gas mixtures because, as
noted above, the likelihood of interactions between gas molecules is
small so that the enthalpy of mixing can often be neglected. Within
these two approximations, the primary difference is that there are no
interactions within an ideal-gas mixture, while in an ideal solution
molecules interact, but all interactions are identical. Thus, we can
think of mixtures of ideal gases as subsets of ideal solutions with the
additional restriction that there are no interactions at all between
molecules, not that the interactions between all molecules are the same.

We can now ask what an appropriate expression for the entropy of mixing
is given the limit that the system energy and volume are unchanged upon
mixing. If we recall all the way back to [Problem Set 1](../problems/ps_1/problem_set_1) in our
Statistical Mechanics unit, we considered this exact problem -
calculating the entropy change for mixing at constant $NVE$. We
calculated the entropy of mixing as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IS} &= \Delta S_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IG} =-R \sum_i x_i \ln x_i
\end{aligned}$$

Putting all of this together, we can then compute the Gibbs free energy
of mixing for each approximation as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\textrm{mix}}^\textrm{IG} &= \Delta H_{\textrm{mix}}^\textrm{IG} - T \Delta S_{\textrm{mix}}^\textrm{IG} \\
&= RT \sum_i x_i \ln x_i \\
&= \Delta G_{\textrm{mix}}^\textrm{IS} 
\end{aligned}$$

Using this expression for the Gibbs free energy of mixing, we can now
derive expressions for the fugacity of a component in an ideal-gas
mixture or ideal solution, recalling that:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_\textrm{mix}^\textrm{IS} &= RT \sum_i x_i \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i^\textrm{IS}}{f_i} =  RT \sum_i x_i \ln x_i \\
\therefore \hat{f}_i^\textrm{IS} &= x_i f_i
\end{aligned}$$

This expression is also called the [Lewis-Randall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugacity#Gases)
expression for the
fugacity of component $i$ in an ideal solution, and tells us that the
fugacity is the same as the fugacity of pure $i$ weighted by its mole
fraction. This approximation makes fugacities significantly simpler to
calculate, as we might have an equation of state for a pure system but
not one for a mixture, for example. For an ideal-gas mixture, the
fugacity of the pure ideal gas is equal to the pressure, so we can then
write:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{f}_i^\textrm{IS} &= x_i f_i \\
\hat{f}_i^\textrm{IG} &= y_i P
\end{aligned}$$

Recalling that we defined the fugacity of a component in a mixture as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\overline{G}_i - \overline{G}_i^0 &= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{y_i P} = RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i}{\hat{f}_i^\textrm{IG}}
\end{aligned}$$

We see that the denominator of this expression is the fugacity of an
ideal-gas mixture, and hence we obtain that the fugacity of a component
in a real system is related to the isothermal departure of the Gibbs
free energy change of that system from ideal-gas mixture behavior, which
is consistent with the definition introduced previously.

We will define one last relation that is commonly used. Recall from
previous sections that we can relate the chemical potential of a
component in a mixture to the fugacity by:

$$\begin{aligned}
d\mu_i &= RT d\ln \hat{f}_i 
\end{aligned}$$

We now consider integrating this expression at constant temperature and
pressure as we transfer component $i$ from a pure component $i$
reference state to an ideal solution to obtain:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_i^\textrm{IS} - \mu_i &= RT \ln \frac{\hat{f}_i^\textrm{IS}}{f_i} \\
&= RT \ln \frac{x_i f_i}{f_i} \\
\therefore \mu_i^\textrm{IS} &= \mu_i + RT \ln x_i
\end{aligned}$$

This expression is commonly used to compute the chemical potential of a
component in an ideal solution as a function of its mole fraction, or
equivalently its concentration through a change of units; recall that
this expression is at constant $T$ and $P$, so typically $\mu_i$ is
measured at standard conditions for a pure system and $x_i$ accounts for
the effect of mixing. Since $0 < x_i < 1$, this tells us that for an
ideal solution the chemical potential of a component is always less than
the chemical potential of that pure component, and that this decrease in
the chemical potential is due to the entropy of mixing.
