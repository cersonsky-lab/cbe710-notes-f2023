## Recap of the four postulates

In the previous lecture, we introduced the four postulates that will
guide our study of thermodynamics, and furthermore discussed the first
law of thermodynamics as derived from Postulate 3. Having defined the
four postulates, we can now think about some of the consequences of
these definitions and examine situations in which postulates would be
violated. For this discussion, it's helpful to remember the postulates
which we paraphrase here:

-   {term}`Postulate 1`: Thermodynamic systems are in stable equilibrium states
    that can be completely characterized by two independently variable
    properties and the masses of system components.

-   {term}`Postulate 2`: In processes for which there is no net effect on the
    environment, systems evolve toward a single stable equilibrium
    state.

-   {term}`Postulate 3`: Any two equilibrium states are connected by at least
    one adiabatic process which uniquely determines the change in energy
    between these two states.

-   {term}`Postulate 4`: If the sets of systems $A$, $B$ and $A$, $C$ each have
    no heat interaction when connected across diathermal walls, then
    there will be no heat interaction if systems $B$ and $C$ are
    connected in the same manner. We can infer that there exists no heat
    interactions between diathermally-connected systems that have the
    same temperature.

## Direction of heat transfer

Let us first show that we can use {term}`Postulate 4` to understand the
directionality of heat transfer. Assume we have 3 systems, labeled
$A, B, C$, with $A$ connected to $B$ and $B$ connected to $C$ as defined
in the postulate. Based on Postulate 4, we define a quantity, the
temperature, which is a {term}`state function` that is equal for two systems
that are connected by diathermal walls when there is no heat interaction. The temperature of $A$, $T_A$, is
greater than $T_B$, and we have heat interactions
$Q_{A \rightarrow B} > 0$ and
$Q_{B \rightarrow C} > 0$. Since heat can flow from
$A\rightarrow B$ and from $B\rightarrow C$, this also then implies that
there is a heat interaction between $A$ and $C$. We will show that this
requires $T_C < T_B$.

```{admonition} Why do we know that $T_B \neq T_C$?
<details><summary> Click for answer</summary>

If $T_B$ equals $T_C$, then we infer from {term}`Postulate 4` that there is no
heat interaction between $B$ and $C$, which contradicts the system
description that $Q_{B \rightarrow C} > 0$.
<details>
```

```{admonition} Why do we know that $T_B \nless T_C$?
<details><summary> Click for answer</summary>

If we were to
allow the systems to interact such that
$Q_{A \rightarrow B} = Q_{B \rightarrow C}$ and
$T_B$ is fixed, then there would be a heat interaction between $A$ and
$C$.
If $T_C > T_B$ then it would be possible for $T_A = T_C$, in
which case there would be no heat interaction between $A$ and $C$ which
would contradict this system description.

```

Thus, $T_C < T_B < T_A$ is determined by the flow of heat in this system.

This shows that heat transfers from a high temperature system to
a low temperature system.

```{admonition} Temperature increases with the energy of a system -- why?

<details><summary> Click for answer</summary>

This follows from {term}`Postulate 2`.
Say that we had a system containing a low-temperature system (LT)
and a high-temperature system (HT), where heat flows from HT to LT.
This exchange of heat would increase the energy of our LT subsystem.
Here we will enforce that heat always flows high-to-low temperature.

Say this increase in energy _lowered_ the temperature of our LT system.
With each exchange in heat, the temperature difference becomes larger, and the
flow of heat continues.
Thus, heat would flow indefinitely and
we would never reach equilibrium, thus violating {term}`Postulate 2`.
We therefore require that $dU/dT > 0$, and will follow
similar logic below.

```

## The First Law for Open Systems

Before moving on, let us consider an application of the {term}`first law of
thermodynamics` to an open system that is able to exchange energy and
particles with the surroundings. First, we can recall the first law for
a closed system:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta U &= \delta Q + \delta W \\
dU &= dQ + dW
\end{aligned}$$

The second line is the differential form of the first law for a closed
system. Recall that the first law
emerged from the definition of {term}`Postulate 3`, where we defined the change
in energy between two states as the work done along an adiabatic path.

```{admonition} What do we have to do to view an open system as a closed one?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>
Just redefine what our boundaries are.
</details>
```

Consider the open system in the figure below, where our system is bounded
by a surface ($\sigma$), but has a diathermal wall where heat $\delta Q_\sigma$ can be
exchanged, a piston that can contribute work $\delta W_\sigma$, and gap in the wall where
$\delta N_{in}$ molecules can enter or leave the system. These molecules
have pressure $P_{in}$, volume $V_{in}$, and energy $E_{in}$.


![image](figs/fig_17_2-01.png)

During time interval $\delta t$, if we define the boundary of our system as our $\sigma$-surface
and the $\delta N_\textrm{in}$ added during the interval, this is a closed system!
We can then write the change in energy during this interval as

$$\begin{aligned}
U_2 - (U_1+U_\textrm{in}\delta N_\textrm{in}) &= \delta Q_\sigma + \delta W_\sigma + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in} \\
\Delta U &= \delta Q_\sigma + \delta W_\sigma +(U_\textrm{in} + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in}) \delta N_\textrm{in} \\
\Delta U &= \delta Q_\sigma + \delta W_\sigma + H_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in}
\end{aligned}$$

Here, we define $U_2$ as the energy of the gas within the
region bounded by the $\sigma$ surface at the end of the process,
including the new gas that has been pumped in. $U_1$ is the
energy of the gas enclosed within the region bounded by the $\sigma$
surface at the start of the process, while
$U_\textrm{in}\delta N_\textrm{in}$ is the energy of the incoming gas.
This expression leads to the definition of a new quantity, the

```{glossary}

enthalpy
    a thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system
```

which, for the gas being pumped in, is defined as

$$\begin{aligned}
H_\textrm{in} = U_\textrm{in} + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in}
\end{aligned}$$


```{admonition} Why is the sign of $P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in}$ positive?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

We are *adding* energy to the system!
</details>
```

This expression then effectively
says that the first law for an open system is adjusted to account for
the enthalpy change associated with the change in the components of the
system. We can generalize this result to multiple components that can
simultaneously enter and leave the system and write it in differential
form (we will not derive this, but it is straightforward to do so):

$$dU = dQ + dW + \sum_{\textrm{in}} H_\textrm{in} d N_\textrm{in} - \sum_{\textrm{out}} H_\textrm{out} d N_\textrm{out}$$

This is the generalized, differential form of the first law for a
multicomponent open system.

## Case studies of postulates

Let us now consider a series of possible processes and, following
similar logic used to determine the directionality of heat transfer,
determine whether each process is possible according to the four
postulates. This approach will lead to a discussion of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. In some cases, we will discuss the behavior of a

```{glossary}

heat engine
    a closed device that contains heat interactions with one
    or more systems and work interactions with a {term}`work reservoir`
    but is always returned to the same state as it
    was prior to the interactions - that is, it only performs **cyclic**
    processes.

work reservoir
    a system that only exchanges work with other systems

```

In this case, our work reservoir operates adiabatically
and [quasi-static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasistatic_process)ally
and is used for storing energy. In each of these cases, we assume that
there are two systems, $A$ and $B$, with corresponding temperatures
$T_A > T_B$. Recall that $dU/dT > 0$ due to
the postulates - that is, increasing the energy of a system (via a heat
transfer, for example) necessarily increases its temperature and vice
versa. Now let us consider six cases and determine if they are possible
or not according to the postulates:

![image](figs/fig_17_3-01.png)

```{admonition} **Case 1:** Heat transfers from system $A$ to system $B$.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>

Yes. This behavior
does not appear to violate any of the postulates since over sufficient
time the temperature of system $A$ will decrease, the temperature of
system $B$ will increase, and eventually an equilibrium will be reached
at which $T_A = T_B$.

</details>
```

![image](figs/fig_17_4-01.png)
```{admonition} **Case 2:** Heat transfers from system $B$ to system $A$.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>

No. This behavior
violates Postulate 2, namely that there is an equilibrium state reached
in the long-time limit - in this case, there is no convergence to a
final state since the temperature would continue to change for both
systems as the temperature of $B$ decreases and the temperature of $A$
increases.

</details>
```


![image](figs/fig_17_5-01.png)
```{admonition} **Case 3:** Work is done on a heat engine by the work reservoir, and the heat engine then transfers heat into system $A$.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>

Yes. This behavior does not
appear to violate any postulates, regardless of whether heat transfers
between $A$ or $B$ (the direction was chosen somewhat arbitrarily).
Because the work reservoir is part of the environment, transferring
energy from the work reservoir to either system via the reservoir does
not violate Postulate 2 since there is a net effect on the environment.
We conclude that work can be done **on** an engine by the environment
and completely transferred as heat into a system.
</details>
```

![image](figs/fig_17_6-01.png)
```{admonition} **Case 4:** Heat is transferred from system $B$ to the heat engine and *ALL* of this energy appears as work in the reservoir, decreasing the temperature of $B$.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>

No. This process violates Postulate 2.

Consider what would happen if we combined Case 3 and 4 -- two separate processes
that be considered isolated, but together *effectively* amount to transferring
heat from $B$ to $A$, which we already showed created a non-convergent system.

By extension,
**any** cyclic process that transfers energy from a system and converts
all of the transferred energy to usable work in the environment is
impossible. Such a process would lead to perpetual motion machines, for
example.

</details>
```

![image](figs/fig_17_7-01.png)
```{admonition} **Case 5:** Heat is transferred from system $A$ to the heat engine. Some of this heat is transferred to system $B$ and some is transferred as work to the work reservoir.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>

Yes. Nothing in this process violates the
postulates, as over sufficiently long amounts of time the heat transfer
between $A$ and $B$ will lead to a stable state. 

</details>
```

![image](figs/fig_17_8-01.png)
```{admonition} **Case 6:** *All* arrows from Case 5 are reversed - heat flows from system $B$ to the heat engine then to system $A$, and work is transferred to the heat engine from the work reservoir.
<details><summary> Is this physically possible?</summary>
Because work is being extracted
from the environment, this process is possible - the injected work makes
up for the transfer of heat, preserving Postulate 2.
</details>
```

The last two cases, Case 5 and 6, are opposites and both centrally
involve the heat engine as a means of controlling the conversion between
heat in the two systems and work in the environment.

In principle, there could be some processes associated with these state that violate the
postulates.

![image](figs/fig_17_9-01.png)

For example, we could start in the vein of Case 5 by transferring
heat $\delta Q = 100$ from $A$ to the engine, then transferring a small amount of
heat $\delta q = 10$ from the engine to $B$, and extracting the rest of the
heat via work from the engine to the environment ($\delta W = 90$).

Say we then define a process in the vein of Case 6 in
which a small amount of work is transferred from the environment to the
engine ($\delta W = 50$), a large heat transfer $\delta Q = 50$ is conducted from $B$ to the
heat engine, then $\delta Q = 100$ is transferred from the engine back to
system $A$. System $A$ has now undergone a cyclic process in which the
net result is tantamount to Case 4, which is impossible. So there must be some limits
placed on the engine which mediates the heat and work interactions,
which we will now discuss.

## Heat engine efficiency

We can now define the
```{glossary}
efficiency
    $\eta \equiv -\frac{\delta W}{\delta Q}$;
    the proportion of work done by the engine
    to the amount of heat added by a hot system

```

We include a negative sign to enforce positive efficiency,
as heat and work should have opposite signs.

Focusing on the heat engine in Case 5, the action of this engine
transfers heat from system $A$ and does work on the environment. 

![image](figs/fig_17_7-01.png)

$$\begin{aligned}
\eta_5 \equiv -\frac{\delta W_E}{\delta Q_A}
\end{aligned}$$

where $\eta_5$ is the efficiency of a heat engine performing Case 5.
$\delta W_E$ is the work performed by the engine during the process and
$\delta Q_A$ is the heat extracted from the hot system, or in this case
system $A$.

```{admonition} What is the efficiency of Case 6?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>


![image](figs/fig_17_8-01.png)

Exactly the same! Case 6 has the same value of work
and heat, but with opposite signs, thus the efficiency would be unchanged. Following
the example of Case 5 and treating the engine as the system, work is
done *by* the heat engine so $\delta W_E < 0$, and heat flows to the
engine away from system $A$ so $\delta Q_A > 0$.

</details>
```

Higher efficiencies indicates that a
higher fraction of the heat transferred from system $A$ is converted
into work on the surroundings (versus being transferred to system $B$)
From the discussion above, we know that the efficiency for Case 5 cannot
equal 1, since that would mean that all of the heat extracted from
system $A$ is usable as work in the environment.

So, let's revisit our postulate-breaking example above and
determine the required relationship between the
efficiencies of these two processes. If we
run these processes such that no net work is done on the environment
(*i.e.* $\delta W_E$ is the same for the engine performing Case 5 and
Case 6), then the combined process is possible and does not violate the
postulates if:

$$\begin{aligned}
\left [\delta Q_A \right]_{\textrm{Case 5}} &\ge \left [\delta Q_A \right]_{\textrm{Case 6}} \\
\therefore \eta_5 &\le \eta_6 < 1
\end{aligned}$$

In other words, processes are where heat is extracted to become work
are less efficient than processes where work is turned into heat.

```{admonition} What postulate would be broken if $\eta_5 > \eta_6$?
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>

Here, $Q_A$ for the process in Case 5 is smaller
than $Q_A$ for the process in Case 6, meaning that less energy is
extracted from $A$ during the process in Case 5 than is returned to $A$
during the process in Case 6. Running these two processes cylically
would thus result in a net transfer of heat from $B$ to $A$ since there
is no net effect on the environment. This transfer is impossible since
it reduces to Case 2.

</details>
```

If $\eta_5 = \eta_6$, then the system and its environment both return to
their initial states. The latter case is referred to as a

```{glossary}

reversible cycle
    a cycle where the action of
    both processes leaves no net effect on the
    system or environment
```

Reversible cycles can only occur if there is no
heat lost due to friction or other processes not considered explicitly
in the two Cases. We will also define a

```{glossary}
reversible heat engine
    any heat engine capable of performing reversible cycles;
    immune from heat lost due to friction or other processes
```

From the discussion above, we
then note that for any reversible heat engine $\eta_5 = \eta_6$, for any
other heat engine $\eta_5 < \eta_6$, for any heat engine $\eta_5 < 1$,
and thus we establish that in general $\eta_5 \le \eta_6 < 1$ (although
in principle $\eta_6 = 1$ is possible for an irreversible engine,
although we will focus henceforth on reversible engines so this
possibility will be ignored). Finally, we note that a reversible heat
engine is the engine capable of extracting the most work from the
process performed in Case 5 during a cyclic process. If we were to
perform Case 5 and then Case 6 using a non-reversible heat engine such
that $\delta Q_A$ were the same in each case, then less work must be
extracted during Case 5 than is returned to the system during Case 6
since $\eta_5 < \eta_6$ and these work terms can only be equal if
$\eta_5 = \eta_6$ and the engine is reversible. Therefore, a reversible
heat engine is of particular interest since it maximizes the work
extracted during cyclic processes (which will be relevant to the
generation of power, for example, when considering the theoretical
efficiency of power plants).

We have just defined a reversible heat engine as one that can perform
the processes in both Case 5 and Case 6 with the same efficiency,
$\eta_5 = \eta_6 \equiv \eta$. In general, a process is reversible if a
second process could be performed to restore the system and all elements
of the surroundings to the initial state, except for differential
changes of second order. It also follows that all reversible processes
are necessarily quasi-static (i.e., they pass through a series of
equilibrium states), although not all quasi-static processes are
necessarily reversible. This observation stems from Postulate 2 - if a
process were not quasi-static, by definition it passes through isolated
non-equilibrium states that then must relax to equilibrium over
sufficiently long times according to Postulate 2. An isolated system
will not spontaneously revert back to the isolated non-equilibrium
state, and the only way to convert it back to its prior state would be
to remove the system from isolation. Thus, the transformation of the
non-equilibrium state to the equilibrium state is irreversible, and as a
result a completely reversible process cannot pass through
non-equilibrium states. To phrase it one more way - *all reversible
processes only pass through equilibrium states along a quasi-static
path*.
