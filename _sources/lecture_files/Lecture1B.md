# Review of thermodynamics

We will begin this course by focusing largely on statistical mechanics.
It is assumed that most students have taken thermodynamics at the
undergraduate level, and thus will be familiar with some basic concepts
that will be re-visited later in the course. We will first briefly
review thermodynamic concepts that will prove necessary for studying
statistical mechanics.

## Goals for today's lecture
- How do we describe thermodynamic systems?
- What is the difference between a state variable and a path-dependent variable? What are some examples?
- What are natural variables? 
- What is equilibrium?
- Given a set of natural variables, how do I define a new thermodynamic potential?

## Description of the system

Let's start with definitions:

```{glossary}
system
    the part of the universe that we seek to study. A system is defined by its _contents_ and _boundaries_

boundaries
    the interface between our system and the surrounding world

surroundings
environment
    the part of the universe in contact with our system
```
---

Systems and their boundaries are described by the following terms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```{glossary}
Closed
    mass does not flow into or out of a closed system (the
    boundaries are impermeable).

Open
    mass can flow into or out of an open system (the
    boundaries are permeable).

```{glossary}
Adiabatic/Insulated
    adiabatic/insulated boundaries prevent the
    transfer of heat/energy.

Diathermal
    diathermal boundaries allow the transfer of
    heat/energy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```{glossary}
Isolated
    an isolated system is closed, rigid, and adiabatic.
```

## Thermodynamic variables

We will define two different types of thermodynamic variables:

```{glossary}
Extensive
    variables depend on the size or amount of material in the
    system. If a system is formed from two subsystems, the extensive
    properties of the combined system are equal to the sum of the extensive
    properties of the subsystems. _For example, the volume and internal
    energy are extensive variables._

Intensive
    variables do not increase
    as the size or amount of the system increases. _For example, the
    temperature and pressure are *always* intensive variables._
```

The ratio of extensive variables (typically an extensive variable divided by the
amount of material) also defines an intensive variable - for example,
the molar volume is an intensive variable. Variables defined by dividing
an extensive variable by the number of particles are sometimes called
**specific properties**, although we will not frequently use that
nomenclature. Conversely, multiplying always intensive variables
(temperature and pressure) by the amount of material does not yield a
meaningful extensive parameter. We will further discuss the definition
of always intensive variables in the material below.

Combining the above, we can consider a gas with $N$ particles in a
volume $V$, temperature $T$, and pressure $P$. If this system were
duplicated and combined, the result would be a gas with $2N$ particles
in a volume $2V$ still at a temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ - the
extensive variables have doubled, but the intensive variables are
unchanged. If we define the density as a specific property $\rho=N/V$,
it is also unchanged upon doubling the system size.

## Work and heat

### Work

```{image} figs/fig_1B_5-01.png
:alt: Demonstration of work
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The mechanical work, $W$, is the product of an intensive generalized
force, $f$, and an extensive generalized displacement, $\Delta x$:


```{math}
W = f \Delta x
```

We will define the work as positive if the work is done *on* the system
by the environment. In differential form, this can be written:

```{math}
:label: PVwork
dW &= fdx \\
W &= \int_A^B fdx
```

Here, $A$ and $B$ indicate the initial and final thermodynamic states
connected by some process. Thermodynamic states are defined by the
values of thermodynamic variables - each state would have a
corresponding volume, temperature, pressure, number of particles, etc.
The process is defined by a specific path through intermediate states
(or non-equilibrium states) as we will discuss again shortly.


```{image} figs/fig_1B_6-01.png
:alt: Demonstration of pressure-volume work
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The most
common example of work we will see is pressure-volume work, or the work
done due to an expansion or compression of a system.

For expansion-contraction work, the generalized force, $f$ is equal to the
negative pressure, $-P$ (by convention) and the generalized displacement
is equal to the change in the volume, $V$:

```{math}
:label: pvwork_differential
dW = -PdV
```

An increase in the system's volume is associated with work being done in
the surroundings. There are many _types_ of work, as summarized below.
The differential parameter here is always extensive, while the prefactor
is always intensive. These
pairs of intensive-extensive variables are referred to as **conjugate
variables**.

Some of you may not have extensively discussed the chemical
potential. Still, it is a quantity conceptually identical to the
fugacity (and used in its definition) as we will discuss [much later in
the course](./Lecture24.md).

**Type of Work**      |  **Equation**  |    **Intensive Property**  |  **Extensive Property**
--------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------
Chemical              |    $\mu dN$    |   chemical potential $\mu$ |   number of molecules in a system $N$
Surface Deformation   |  $\sigma dA$   |       stress $\sigma$      |         area $A$
Elongation            |   $\tau dL$    |        tension $\tau$      |        length $L$
Magnetic              |     $H dM$     |      magnetic field $H$    |    magnetization $M$

### Heat

The heat absorbed by (added to) the system from its surroundings during
as it goes from state $A$ to state $B$ is

```{math}
:label: heat
Q = \int_A^B dQ
```

Both work and heat (equations {eq}`PVwork` and {eq}`heat`)
rely on integrals that depend on the exact path taken
between state $A$ and state $B$.

However, the difference in the internal
energy, $E$, between state $A$ and $B$ does not depend on the path. $E$
is thus called a

```{glossary}

state function
    a function that is a property of each state and not the path between them
```

We can write the change in $E$
between states $A$ and $B$, $\Delta E$, for a system undergoing a change
in volume as the:

```{glossary}
first law of thermodynamics

    $$\begin{aligned}
        \Delta E = E_B - E_A &= Q + W \\
        &= \int_A^B dQ - \int_A^B PdV
    \end{aligned}$$
```

This equation is the {term}`first law of thermodynamics` and defines the
conservation of energy. Note that since each path passes through
intermediate states which may vary in pressure, $P$ is within the
integral above as its value will depend on the specific path taken. The
same change in energy will be obtained for any arbitrary path, though,
so we are free to calculate the change in energy along the path that is
most convenient for a given calculation (*e.g.*, along a path for which
the pressure is constant).

![image](figs/fig_1B_7-01.png)

## Entropy

The second law of thermodynamics defines another {term}`state function` called
the **entropy**, $S$. Entropy is conceptually equivalent to the amount
of uncertainty pertaining to any given macrostate (more on this later).
The combined entropy of a system and its surroundings (*i.e.*, the
universe) always increases in an irreversible process and remains
constant in a reversible process; it never decreases. The entropy of the
system can decrease as long as there is a corresponding increase in the
entropy of the surroundings such that the total entropy of the universe
is constant or increases. The change in entropy between states $A$ and
$B$ is $\Delta S = \int_A^B dS = \int_A^B  \frac{dQ_{\mathrm{rev}}}{T}$,
therefore:

```{math}
:label: entropychange
    dQ_{\mathrm{rev}} = TdS
```

The subscript on $dQ$ indicates that the change in entropy is defined
along a *reversible* path from $A$ to $B$. For irreversible processes,
the second law of thermodynamics states

```{math}
:label: entropychange_nonrev
\Delta S > \int_A^B  \frac{dQ}{T}
```

```{admonition} What is the lower limit for entropy in an isolated system?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>
  In an isolated system, dQ = 0 for all processes since no heat can exchange with
the universe. Therefore, S is always greater than or equal to 0.
</details>
```


## The fundamental relation of thermodynamics

For a system undergoing a reversible process, we can write a combined
first and second law of thermodynamics (assuming a one-component system)
by combining equations
{eq}`pvwork_differential` and
{eq}`entropychange`:

$$\begin{aligned}
dE &= dQ + dW \\
&= TdS - PdV \label{combo_first_second}
\end{aligned}$$

This expression is also called the [**fundamental relation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_thermodynamic_relation) of
thermodynamics in the **energy representation**. We can write an
equivalent expression in terms of the entropy:


```{math}
dS = \frac{1}{T} dE + \frac{P}{T} dV
```

This is called the fundamental relation in the entropy representation.
Because energy is a **state variable** can also write an [**exact differential**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_differential) of $dE$ to obtain
expressions for an intensive variables:


```{math}
dE = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}\right)_V dS + \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\right)_S dV
```

Comparing this expression with the fundamental relation in the energy
representation yields:

```{math}
:label: de_ds
\left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}\right)_V = T
```

and

```{math}
:label: de_dv
\left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\right)_S = -P
```

The subscripts indicate that the partial derivative is taken with the
subscripted variable held constant; in other words, Equation {eq}`de_ds`
states that the temperature is defined as the partial derivative of the internal
energy with respect to entropy at constant volume. Using these
relations, we find that for each pair of conjugate variables that
appears in the fundamental relation, the variable that is always
intensive can be expressed as a partial derivative of either the energy
or the entropy with respect to its conjugate extensive variable and with
all other extensive variables held constant.

## Conjugate Variables


Each pair of variables that appear in our fundamental relations is called a pair
of [**conjugate variables**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables_(thermodynamics)), consisting of an intensive prefactor and
extensive differential. The four most common sets of conjugate pairs
that we will discuss are:

-   Temperature ($T$, intensive) and entropy ($S$, extensive)

-   Temperature ($T$, intensive) and energy ($E$, extensive; from
    entropy representation of fundamental relation, where $E$ and $S$ swap roles)

-   Pressure ($P$, intensive) and volume ($V$, extensive)

-   Chemical potential ($\mu$, intensive) and number of particles ($N$,
    extensive)

## Natural variables

We can extend the fundamental relation to include additional work terms
(*i.e.*, additional conjugate pairs) by writing:

$$dE = TdS - PdV + \mu dN + \text{other work terms}$$

We will typically omit work terms other than pressure-volume and
chemical work unless required to include them by a specific problem.

In our previous sections, we have shown how we can write our intensive
variables ($T, -P, \mu$) as a partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to its
conjugate extensive variable.
Therefore, we could write our fundamental relation _without_ these variables,
instead only in terms of $N$, $V$, and $S$.
Because of this, $N$, $V$, and $S$ are called the **natural variables** of the internal
energy.

```{glossary}
natural variables
   the variables that, if they were held constant, then the corresponding thermodynamic potential would also be constant;
   because of the exact differential relationship between a thermodynamic potential and its natural variables,
   we can write any thermodynamic potential in terms of *only* its natural variables.
```


```{admonition} What is the differential of internal energy (dE) in a system where we hold N, V, and S constant?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>
 For any process in which N, V, and S are held constant,  dE = 0 and therefore E(N, V, S) is at an extremum.

If we were to control the natural variables via suitable
experimental manipulation, or by imposing the appropriate boundaries on
a system, we could then predict that the corresponding thermodynamic
potential would go to an extreme. We will take advantage of this
behavior later.
</details>
```


## Equilibrium

A system is said to be **at equilibrium** when there is no driving force
to change intensive variables in the system and the system's properties
do not change as a function of time. A system that is at equilibrium is
described as being in an **equilibrium state** which is fully specified
by the values of the thermodynamic parameters described above. The three
most relevant conditions of equilibrium that we will discuss are:

```{glossary}
Thermal equilibrium
    if a system has diathermal walls, at
    equilibrium the temperature of the system will be equivalent to the
    temperature of the surroundings, or
    $T^\textrm{sys} = T^\textrm{surr}$.

Mechanical equilibrium
    if a system has movable walls, at
    equilibrium the pressure of the system will be equivalent to the
    pressure of the surroundings, or $P^\textrm{sys} = P^\textrm{surr}$.

Chemical equilibrium
    if a system has open walls, at equilibrium
    the chemical potential of each component of the system will be
    equivalent to the chemical potential of each component in the
    surroundings, or $\mu_i^\textrm{sys} = \mu_i^\textrm{surr}$.
```

In each case, the system is free to exchange an extensive variable and
the corresponding intensive variable is then constant. These pairs of
variables are again the conjugate pairs mentioned above. A given system
can satisfy multiple conditions of equilibrium simultaneously.

### Additional thermodynamic potentials

It is possible to write other expressions, called **thermodynamic
potentials**, that are equivalent in information content to the
fundamental relation but have a different set of natural variables. In
the [third unit](Lecture15.md) of this class, we will show that these relations are
equivalent; here, we will only focus on the method for defining them.
The procedure is as follows:

-   Identify the desired natural variables of the new potential (e.g.,
    $N,V,T$)

-   For any natural variable that is different from the natural
    variables of the internal energy (i.e., $N,V,S$), subtract the
    product of the desired natural variable and its conjugate from the
    internal energy, $E$. The new expression defines the equivalent
    thermodynamic potential.



```{admonition} What is the expression for enthalpy H, whose natural variables are N, P, and S?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>

This differs from the internal energy by the variable P, so we subtract the
product of P and its conjugate (V) to generate the expression for
the enthalpy. The slight caveat here is that in our sign convention it
is -P, not P, that is used in the conjugate pair, so we subtract
-P instead:

$$H = E - (-PV) = E + PV$$

therefore

$$
dH &= dE + PdV + VdP\\
   &= TdS - PdV + \mu dN + PdV + VdP
   &= TdS + \mu dN + VdP
$$


</details>
```


```{admonition} Write the equation for enthalpy only in terms of its natural variables.
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>
  Here we replace each non-natural variable with the derivative of enthalpy, holding the appropriate natural variables constant.


$$\begin{aligned}
    dH &= \left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right )_{P,N} dS + \left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right )_{S,N} dP +  \left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial N}\right )_{S,P} dN \\
    & \left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right )_{P,N} = T \\
    &   \left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right )_{S,N}  = V \\
    &\left ( \frac{\partial H}{\partial N}\right )_{S,P} = \mu
\end{aligned}$$
```

```{admonition} What is the expression for Helmholtz free energy F, whose natural variables are N, V, and T?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>

This differs from the internal energy by the variable T, so we subtract the
product of T and its conjugate (S) to generate the expression for
the Helmholtz free energy. 

$$F = E - (TS)$$

therefore

$$
dF &= dE - TdS - SdT\\
   &= TdS - PdV + \mu dN - TdS - SdT\\
   &= \mu dN + - PdV - SdT
$$


</details>
```

```{admonition} What is the expression for Gibbs free energy G, whose natural variables are N, P, and T?
<details>
  <summary><b></b>[Click for answer]</summary>

This differs from the internal energy by the variable T and P, so we subtract the
products of T and P (and their conjugates) to generate the expression for
the Helmholtz free energy. 

$$G = E - TS + PV$$

therefore

$$
dF &= dE - TdS - SdT + PdV + VdP\\
   &= TdS - PdV + \mu dN - TdS - SdT + PdV + VdP\\
   &= \mu dN + VdP - SdT
$$


</details>
```

We will return to these expressions repeatedly throughout our discussion
of statistical mechanics, and will discuss thermodynamic relations in
more detail later in the course. If the importance of natural variables
is not clear, you can first see that different thermodynamic potentials
will reach extremum values when different conditions of equilibrium
occur. For example, a system with impermeable, rigid, diathermal walls
that reaches thermal equilibrium with the surroundings will have
constant $N$, $V$, and $T$, and thus the Helmholtz free energy (with
corresponding natural variables) will reach an extremum value. Analysis
of the Helmholtz free energy can then be used to understand how changes
to this system properties affect its equilibrium behavior. We will
further use the natural variables to connect to statistical mechanics as
will be discussed in future lectures. For now, we conclude our review of
thermodynamics.
